        "content": "I love heavy games, but I’ve definitely had moments where teaching something like Gaia Project or Ark Nova just made everyone’s eyes glaze over.\n\nWhat are your best tips for teaching big or rule-heavy games to a group? Especially when they have mixed experience levels?\n\nDo you start with a theme overview, skip some rules, jump into a mock round, or just read the manual out loud (😬)? I’d love to hear your teaching hacks, your fails, or even what not to do.",
