# Database Sequence Fix - Issue Resolved

## Problem
You were getting this error when adding games:
```
Error adding game: Invalid `prisma.gameDescription.create()` invocation: Unique constraint failed on the fields: (`id`)
```

## Root Cause
The PostgreSQL database auto-increment sequences were out of sync. This happens when:
- Records are inserted with explicit IDs
- Data is imported from another source
- The sequence counter gets manually reset

When the sequence is out of sync, it tries to use an ID that already exists in the table, causing the unique constraint error.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Database Transaction (Already Done)
Modified `app/api/boardgames/route.ts` to use Prisma transactions, ensuring all operations (game, description, rules) succeed or fail together.

### 2. Fixed Database Sequences (Just Completed)
Ran `scripts/fix-db-sequences.js` which reset all auto-increment sequences to their correct values:

- ✅ `game_descriptions` sequence
- ✅ `game_rules` sequence  
- ✅ `games` sequence
- ✅ `categories` sequence
- ✅ `mechanics` sequence
- ✅ `expansions` sequence

## Result
✨ **Your database is now fixed!** 

You can now:
- Add games with rules using the web scraper
- Rules will be saved correctly on the first attempt
- No more "unique constraint" errors
- No more manually adding rules after game creation

## If the Error Happens Again

Simply run:
```bash
node scripts/fix-db-sequences.js
```

This script is now available in your project and can be run anytime to fix sequence issues.

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/boardgames/route.ts` - Added transaction support + better error handling
2. `scripts/fix-db-sequences.js` - Created sequence fix script (NEW)
3. `scripts/fix-sequences.sql` - Created SQL fix script (NEW)
