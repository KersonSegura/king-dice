If this person also plays, then he must keep his personal funds separated from those of the bank.</p>\n\n<p>The Bank holds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of all properties which it sells and auctions.</p>\n\n<p>The Bank can't go broken, if the Bank runs out of money, the Banker may issue as much as needed by writing on any ordinary paper.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/bank.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>Become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling of property and force other players into bankruptcy.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Starting with the Banker, each player throws the dice. The player with the highest total starts the play.</p>\n\n<p>Then each player places his token on the corner marked \"GO\", and throw the dice and move his the number of spaces indicated by the dice.</p>\n\n<p>The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from that point on the player's next turn.</p>\n\n<p>Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>If one or both dice roll off the board, or land on or lean against a card deck, the roll is invalid. Roll them again.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the space the token reaches, you may buy the property, or be obliged to pay rent, pay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest card, Go To Jail, or etc...</p>\n\n<p>If you throw doubles, you move your token and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to the space on which you land. Then you can throw again and move your token as before.</p>\n\n<p>But watch out, if you ever throw doubles three times in succession, you have to go immediately to jail.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Go</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/monopoly-go.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Each time a player's token lands on or passes over GO, whether by throw of the dice or by drawing a card, the Banker pays that player a $200 salary.</p>\n\n<p>However, $200 is paid only once each time around the board. If a player, passing \"GO\" on the throw of the dice, lands 2 spaces beyond it on \"Community Chest\", or 7 spaces beyond it on \"Chance\", and draws the card \"Advance to GO\", he collects $200 for passing \"GO\" the first time and another $200 for reaching it the second time by instructions on the card.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Buying Property</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/title-deed.gif\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When you land on an unowned property you can buy that property from the Bank at its printed price.</p>\n\n<p>You receive the Title Deed card showing ownership.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not wish to buy the property, the Bank sells it at thru an auction to the highest bidder. The buyer pays to the Bank the amount of the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property.</p>\n\n<p>Any player, including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price, may bid and bidding may start at any price.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Paying Rent</h2>\n\n<p>When you land on a property that is owned by another player, the owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list printed on its Title Deed card.</p>\n\n<p>If the property is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed face down in front of the owner and he can not collect a rent.</p>\n\n<p>It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color-group because the owner may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to unmortgaged properties even if another property in that color-group is mortgaged.</p>\n\n<p>It is more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties because then rents become much higher.</p>\n\n<p><i>Note: The owner may not collect the rent if they fail to ask the rent before the next player throws his dice.</i></p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/community-chest.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Chance And Community Chest</h2>\n\n<p>When you land on either of these spaces, take the top card from the deck indicated, and follow the instructions on the card.</p>\n\n<p>Return the card face down to the bottom of the deck.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck.</p>\n\n<p>If the player who draws it does not wish to use it, then they may sell it to another player at a price agreeable to both.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Income Tax</h2>\n\n<p>When you land on \"Income Tax\" you have two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Jail</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/jail.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You land in Jail when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>When you are sent to Jail, you must move directly into Jail and you can not collect $200 salary if you need to pass to Go. Also your turn ends when you are sent to Jail.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not \"sent to jail\" but in the ordinary course of play lands on that space, you are \"Just Visiting\" and you move ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.</p>\n\n<p>A player gets out of Jail by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Even though you are in Jail, you may buy and sell property, houses and hotels and collect rents.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Free Parking</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/free-parking.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>This is just a \"free\" resting place, so the player landing on it doesn't receive money, property, reward or penalty of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>Try to avoid to come here early in game, but later on the game it can be a great target.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Houses And Hotels</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/monopoly-houses.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When a player owns all the properties in a color-group, he or she may buy houses from the Bank.</p>\n\n<p>You may buy as many houses as your judgment and financial standing will allow, but you cannot erect more than one house on any one property of any color-group until you have built one house on every property of that group.</p>\n\n<p>The price you must pay the Bank for each house is shown on your Title Deed card for the property on which you erect the house.</p>\n\n<p>The owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of his/her complete color-group.</p>\n\n<p>When a player has four houses on each property of a complete color-group, they may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect it on any property of the color-group. Only one hotel may be erected on any one property.</p>\n\n<p>As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell houses back to the Bank.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Building Shortages</h2>\n\n<p>When the Bank has no houses to sell, players wishing to build must wait for some player to return or sell their houses to the Bank before building.</p>\n\n<p>If there are a limited number of houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more than the Bank has, the houses/hotels will be sold at auction to the highest bidder.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Selling Property</h2>\n\n<p>Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities may be sold to any player as a private transaction for any amount the owner can get.</p>\n\n<p>However, properties can not be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color-group.</p>\n\n<p>The buildings must be sold back to the Bank before the owner can sell any property of that color-group.</p>\n\n<p>Houses and Hotels can be sold back to the bank at any time for one-half the price paid for them.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/title-deed.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Mortgages</h2>\n\n<p>Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the Bank at any time. The mortgage value is printed on each Title Deed card.</p>\n\n<p>When properties has buildings, then these must be sold back to the back at half price first.</p>\n\n<p>No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities.</p>\n\n<p>In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the amount of mortgage plus 10% interest.</p>\n\n<p>When all the properties of a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy back houses or hotels.</p>\n\n<p>The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.</p>\n\n<p>But the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player at any agreed price and the new owner can lift the mortgage by paying off the mortgage plus 10% interest to the Bank.</p>\n\n<p>When the mortgage if not lifted at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when you buy the property and if you lift the mortgage later you must pay the Bank an additional 10% interest.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Bankruptcy</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/monopoly/bankruptcy.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than you can pay to another player or to the Bank.</p>\n\n<p>If your debt is to another player, you must turn over all that you have to that player.</p>\n\n<p>If you own houses or hotels, you must return these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them and this cash is given to the creditor.</p>\n\n<p>If you have mortgaged property you also turn this property over to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay the Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property.</p>\n\n<p>Should you owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than you can pay, you must turn over all assets to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all property except buildings.</p>\n\n<p>Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank (by mortgaging property) and no other player may borrow from or lend money to another player.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>Bankrupt players must retire from the game and the last player left in the game is the winner..</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>How to play a short game</h3>\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"fast-monopoly.php\">additional rules to play Monopoly faster.</a></p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br><h2>Other Monopoly Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"anti-monopoly-rules.php\">Anti-Monopoly</a></li><li><a href=\"city-game-rules.php\">Monopoly City</a></li><li><a href=\"cheaters-edition.php\">Monopoly Cheaters Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"deadpool-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Deadpool</a></li><li><a href=\"deal-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Deal</a></li><li><a href=\"fortnite.php\">Monopoly Fortnite</a></li><li><a href=\"millennials-game-rules.php\">Monopoly for Millennials</a></li><li><a href=\"frozen-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Frozen II</a></li><li><a href=\"game-of-thrones-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Game of Thrones</a></li><li><a href=\"friends.php\">Monopoly Friends</a></li><li><a href=\"gamer-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Gamer</a></li><li><a href=\"junior-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Junior</a></li><li><a href=\"junior-electronic-banking-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Junior Electronic Banking</a></li><li><a href=\"junior-party-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Junior Party</a></li><li><a href=\"ms-monopoly-game-rules.php\">Ms. Monopoly</a></li><li><a href=\"marvel-avengers-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Marvel Avengers</a></li><li><a href=\"longest-game-ever-rules.php\">Monopoly - Longest Game Ever</a></li><li><a href=\"peppa-pig.php\">Monopoly Peppa Pig</a></li><li><a href=\"socialism-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Socialism</a></li><li><a href=\"stranger-things.php\">Monopoly Stranger Things</a></li><li><a href=\"mega-edition-game-rules.php\">Monopoly - The Mega Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"the-simpsons.php\">Monopoly The Simpsons</a></li><li><a href=\"speed.php\">Monopoly Speed</a></li><li><a href=\"revolution-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Revolution</a></li><li><a href=\"star-wars-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Star Wars</a></li><li><a href=\"toy-story-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Toy Story</a></li><li><a href=\"ultimate-banking-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Ultimate Banking</a></li><li><a href=\"voice-banking-game-rules.php\">Monopoly Voice Banking</a></li></ul>\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"tips.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Then mix or shuffle them.</p>\n\n<p>Draw a letter to decide who will start to play. The one with the letter closest to \"A\" starts. A blank title beats any letter.</p>\n\n<p>When both players draw the same letter, draw another one. Now return all letters to the pool and remix (shuffle) them.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/scrabble/scrabble-rack.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>the players draw seven new letters each and put them on their racks.</p>\n\n<p>Pick also a player to keep score on paper.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the players should agree which dictionary they will use, in case of a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>All words labeled as a part of speech (including those listed of foreign origin, and as archaic, obsolete, colloquial, slang, etc). are permitted with the exception of the following: words always capitalized, abbreviations, prefixes and suffixes standing alone, words requiring a hyphen or an apostrophe.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The players form words on the gameboard using letters from their racks. Each letter has a different value.</p>\n\n<p>On the board, some premium squares can increase the letter or word value. The player with the highest final score wins the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/scrabble/first-word.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The first player combines 2 or more of his or her letters to form a word. He places this word on the board to read either across or down with one letter on the center square. Diagonal words are not allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Since it uses a \"premium square\", the score for this first word is doubled. Count and announce the score for that turn.</p>\n\n<p>Complete the turn by drawing as many new letters as you placed on the board.</p>\n\n<p>Then draw as many new letters as you played; You must always keep 7 letters on your rack (as long as there are enough tiles left).</p>\n\n<p>The play passes to the next player left.</p>\n\n<p>Each in turn, every player adds one or more letters to those already played to form new words.</p>\n\n<p>All letters played on a turn must be placed in one row across or down the board, to form at least one complete word. If, at the same time, they touch others letters in adjacent rows, those must also form complete words, crossword fashion, with all such letters. The player gets full credit for all words formed or modified on his or her turn.</p>\n\n<p>New words may be formed by:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p><ul>\n<li>Adding one or more letters to letters already on the board.</li>\n<li>Placing a word at right angles to a word already on the board.

Each continent is a different color and exists of 4 to 12 territories.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers along the bottom (southern) edge of the board indicate the number of armies you will receive for a set of cards you trade in.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/risk/board.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>The Armies</h3>\n\n<p>There are six complete sets of armies, each containing three types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Infantry (worth l)</li>\n<li>Cavalry (worth 5 Infantry)</li>\n<li>Artillery (worth 10 Infantry, or 2 Cavalry)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Start the game by placing Infantry pieces. Later, you can trade in 5 Infantry for 1 Cavalry, or 2 Cavalry (or 1 Cavalry and 5 Infantry) for 1 Artillery.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Cards</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>42 Cards are marked with a territory and a picture of Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Two \"wild\" cards marked with all three pictures, but no territory.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>12 Secret Mission cards used only in Secret Mission Risk. These cards are only used in the secret mission variation, else you have to remove them.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/risk/cards2.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box red_border yellow5_bg\">\n\n<p>To conquer the world by occupying all territories on the board. You need to eliminate all your opponents.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>Select a color and, depending on the number of players, count out the \"armies\" you'll need to start the game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If 2 are playing, see <a href=\"risk-for-2-players.php\">special instructions</a>.</li>\n<li>If 3 are playing, each player counts out 35 Infantry.</li>\n<li>If 4 are playing, each player counts out 30 Infantry.</li>\n<li>If 5 are playing, each player counts out 25 Infantry.</li>\n<li>If 6 are playing, each player counts out 20 Infantry.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Roll one die. Whoever rolls the highest number takes one Infantry piece from his or her pile and places it onto any territory on the board, thus claiming that territory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Starting to the left of the first player, in turn, everyone places one army onto any unoccupied territory. Continue until all 42 territories have been claimed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>After all 42 territories are claimed, each player in turn places one additional army onto any territory he or she already occupies.</p>\n\n<p>Continue in this way until everyone has run out of armies. There is no limit to the number of armies you may place onto a single territory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Shuffle the pack of RISK cards (maybe, remove the Mission cards) and place the cards face down by the side of the board.</p>\n\n<p>This pack forms the draw pile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Whoever placed the first army opens the game.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>On your turn, try to capture territories by defeating your opponents' armies. But be careful: Winning battles will depend on careful planning, quick decisions, and bold moves.</p>\n\n<p>You will have to place your forces wisely, attack at just the right time and fortify your defenses against all enemies.</p>\n\n<div class=\" notepad\">\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> At any time during the game, you may trade in Infantry pieces for the equivalent in Cavalry or Artillery if you need to, or wish to.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow2_border grey4_bg\">\n\n<p>Each of your turns consists of three steps, in this order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Getting and placing new armies.</li>\n<li>Attacking.</li>\n<li>Fortifying your position.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>I. Placing New Armies</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/risk/troops.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>At the beginning of each turn, calculate how many new armies you can add to your territories based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of territories you occupy.</li>\n<li>The value of the continents you control.</li>\n<li>The value of the matched sets of RISK cards you trade in.</li>\n<li>The specific territory pictured on a traded-in card.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Territories</h3>\n\n<p>At the beginning of every turn (including your first), count the number of territories you currently occupy, then divide the total by three (ignore any fraction).</p>\n\n<p>The answer is the number of armies you receive. Place the new armies on any territory you already occupy.</p>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> 11 territories = 3 armies, 14 territories = 4 armies, 17 territories = 5 armies. You will always receive at least 3 armies on a turn, even if you occupy fewer than 9 territories.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Continents</h3>\n\n<p>In addition, at the beginning of your turn, you will receive armies for each continent you control. (To control a continent, you must occupy all its territories at the start of your turn).</p>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow2_border\">\n\n<p>The number of extra armies is different for each continent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asia: 7</li>\n<li>Nort America: 5</li>\n<li>Europe: 5</li>\n<li>Africa: 3</li>\n<li>South America: 2</li>\n<li>Australia: 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>These numbers can be different depending on the version of Risk you are playing. To find the exact number of armies, look at the chart in the lower left-hand corner of the game board.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Risk Cards</h2>\n\n<h3>Earning Cards</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of any turn in which you have captured at least one territory, you will earn one (and only one) RISK card.</p>\n\n<p>You are trying to collect sets of 3 cards in any of the following combinations: 3 cards of the same design (Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery), 1 each of 3 designs, or any 2 plus a \"wild\" card.</p>\n\n<p>If you have collected a set of 3 RISK cards, you may turn them in at the start of your next turn, or you may wait. But if you have 5 or 6 cards at the beginning of your turn, you must trade in at least one set and may trade in a second set if you have one.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Trading in Cards for Armies</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/risk/trading.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>At the beginning of subsequent turns, you may trade in matched sets of cards and take additional armies based on the total number of sets anyone has traded in so far. For quick reference, keep traded-in cards face down under the bottom edge of the game board to mark the value (in armies) of the next trade.</p>\n\n<p>After the sixth set has been traded in, each additional set is worth 5 more armies. Example: If you trade in the seventh set, you get 20 armies; if you trade in the eighth, you get 25 armies, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>\"First\" and \"second\" set, etc., refer to sets traded in by anyone during the game. Thus, if you trade in the 3rd set in the game, you receive 8 armies, even if itis the first set you have traded in.</p>\n\n<p>Occupied territories: If any of the 3 cards you trade in shows the picture of a territory you occupy, you receive 2 extra armies. You must place both those armies onto that particular territory.</p>\n\n<div class=\" notepad\">\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> On a single turn, you may receive no more than 2 extra armies above and beyond those you receive for the matched sets of cards you trade in.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"infobox\"><div class=\"info-icon\"><i></i></div><div class=\"infobox-body\">\n\n<p><b>Tip:</b> No matter how many armies you receive at the start of your turn, deploy them carefully-either to prepare for an attack or to defend against one.</p>\n\n<p>It is a an excellent military strategy to move your armies to the front, heavily fortifying territories that border enemy territories.</p>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>II. Attacking</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/risk/attacking.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>After placing your armies at the beginning of your turn, decide if you wish to attack at this time.</p>\n\n<p>The object of an attack is to capture a territory by defeating all the opposing armies already on it. The battle is fought by a roll of the dice. Study the board for a moment. Do you want to attack?</p>\n\n<p>If you choose not to attack, pass the dice to the player on your left. You may still fortify your position if you wish. If you decide to attack, you must follow these rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>You may only attack a territory that's adjacent (touching) to one of your own, or connected to it by a dashed line.</p>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p>Examples: Greenland may attack the Northwest Territory, Ontario, Quebec, and Iceland. North Africa may attack Egypt, Western Europe, and Brazil. At the western and eastern edges of the board, Alaska is considered adjacent to and may attack, Kamchatka.</p>\n\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>You must always have at least two armies in the territory you're attacking from.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>You may continue attacking one territory until you have eliminated all armies on it, or you may shift your attack from one territory to another, attacking each as often as you want and attacking as many territories as you like during one turn.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>To Attack</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/risk/dice.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>First, announce both the territory you're attacking and the one you are attacking from. Then roll the dice against the opponent who occupies the opposing territory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>Before rolling, both you and your opponent must announce the number of dice you intend to roll, and you both must roll at the same time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>You, the attacker, will roll 1, 2 or 3 red dice: You must have at least one more army in your territory than the number of dice you roll.</p>\n\n<div class=\"infobox\"><div class=\"info-icon\"><i></i></div><div class=\"infobox-body\">\n\n<p><b>Hint:</b> The more dice you roll, the higher your odds of winning. Yet the more dice you roll, the more armies you may lose, or be required to move into a captured territory.</p>\n\n</div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>The defender will roll either 1 or 2 white dice: To roll 2 dice, he or she must have at least 2 armies on the territory under attack. Hint: The more dice the defender rolls, the higher his or her odds of winning, but the more armies he or she may lose.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>To Decide a Battle</h3>\n\n<p>Compare the highest die each of you rolled. If yours (the attackers) is higher, the defender loses one army from the territory under attack.</p>\n\n<p>But if the defender's die is higher than yours, you lose one army from the territory you attacked from; put it back in your clear plastic box.</p>\n\n<p>If each of you rolled more than one die, now compare the two next-highest dice and repeat the process.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/risk/battle.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>III. Fortifying your Position</h2>\n\n<p>No matter what you have done on your turn, you may end your turn by fortifying your position.</p>\n\n<p>You are not required to win a battle or even to try an attack to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Some players refer to this as the \"free move\".</p>\n\n<p>To fortify your position, move as many armies as you would like from one (and only one) of your territories into one (and only one) of your adjacent territories.</p>\n\n<p>Remember to move troops towards borders where they can help in an attack and leave at least one army behind.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box red_border yellow5_bg\">\n\n<p>The winner is the first player to eliminate every opponent by capturing all 42 territories on the board.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"continents.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Players generally decide who will get to be white by chance such having one player guess the color of the hidden pawn in the other player's hand.</p>\n\n<p>Each player is obligated to move on their turn.</p>\n\n<p>There are six kinds of pieces in chess: king, queen, rook, bishop, knight and the pawn.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/chess/opening.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The chessboard is laid out so the white color square in the bottom right-hand side.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second row is filled with 8 pawns.</li>\n<li>The rooks go in the corners</li>\n<li>then the knights</li>\n<li>then the bishops</li>\n<li>then the queens (white queen on white, black queen on black)</li>\n<li>the king on the remaining square.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape from capture.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Video Tutorial</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bzhx3zra5QM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Check, Checkmate and Stalemate</h2>\n\n<p>A check is an immediate threat to capture the king.</p>\n\n<p>In the following move, the player whose king is in check must get his king out of check.</p>\n\n<p>This can be done by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>moving the king to a space where the king is no longer in check</li>\n<li>interposing a piece between the threatening piece and the king</li>\n<li>by capturing the threatening piece</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the king is in check and there is no legal move which gets the king out of check, the king is said to be checkmated and the game is over.</p>\n\n<p>The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his king is not in check. The game is said to end in 'stalemate'.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>How The Pieces Move</h2>\n\n<h4>Pawn</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/chess/pawn.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways. They move forward, but capture diagonally.</p>\n\n<p>Pawns can move only one square forward and may not move backwards.</p>\n\n<p>The first time each pawn is moved from its initial position, it has the option to advance two squares.</p>\n\n<p>Any piece directly in front of a pawn (friend or foe) blocks its advance.</p>\n\n<p>The eight pawns are set on rows two.</p>\n\n<p>The pawn is maybe the least powerful piece in chess, but it can promote to any other piece.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Capturing</h4>\n\n<p>A pawn captures diagonally one square forward and to the left or right.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Promotion</h4>\n\n<p>A pawn that advances to the opposite side of the board is promoted to another piece of that player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color.</p>\n\n<p>The pawn is immediately replaced by the new piece and the choice of promotion is not limited to captured pieces.</p>\n\n<p>Players may have as many as ten knights, ten bishops, ten rooks or nine queens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>En Passant</h4>\n\n<p>An even more unusual move is the en passant capture which is French for \"in passing\".</p>\n\n<p>If a pawn moves out two squares on its first move and lands to the side of an opponent's pawn, that other pawn has the option of capturing the first pawn as it passes by.</p>\n\n<p>This special move must be done immediately after the first pawn has moved past, otherwise the option to capture it is no longer available.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Bishop</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/chess/bishop.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The bishop moves diagonal and has no restrictions in distance (1 square, 2 squares, 3 squares, ..)..</p>\n\n<p>The bishop stays always on its starting color, which can be seen as a little weakness.</p>\n\n<p>The bishop is placed on the 3rd and 6th column.</p>\n\n<p>Bishops cannot jump over other pieces (enemy or own pieces).</p>\n\n<p>For: <a href=\"bishop.php\">more information about the bishop</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Knight</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/chess/knight.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>A knight moves unusal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>two squares horizontally and one square vertically</li>\n<li>two squares vertically and one square horizontally</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The complete move therefore looks like the shape of letter \"L\".</p>\n\n<p>Knights are placed on the 2nd and 7th columns.</p>\n\n<p>The knight can jump over all other pieces to its destination.</p>\n\n<p>For: <a href=\"knight.php\">more information about the knight</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Rook</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/chess/rook.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The rook moves horizontally or vertically and has no restrictions in distance (1 square, 2 squares, 3 squares, ..)..</p>\n\n<p>Rooks are set on the 1st and 8th column.</p>\n\n<p>Rooks can be powerfull when they protect each other.</p>\n\n<p>Rooks cannot jump over other pieces (enemy or own pieces).</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Queen</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/chess/queen.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The queen moves horizontally, vertically and diagonal and has no restrictions in distance (1 square, 2 squares, 3 squares, ..)..</p>\n\n<p>The queen can be seen as the most powerful piece.</p>\n\n<p>The queens are set up on 4th column.</p>\n\n<p>It cannot capture nor move trough a piece on its own side.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>King</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/chess/king.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The king moves horizontally, vertically and diagonal and only 1 square.</p>\n\n<p>A king can also not move onto a square that is threatened by an opponents piece.</p>\n\n<p>The king is the most important piece, when you loose him, you are lost.</p>\n\n<p>The king is placed on the 5th column.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<h5>Castling</h5>\n\n<p>Castling consists of moving the king two squares toward either one of the original rooks, then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed.</p>\n\n<p>Castling is allowed when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it must be the king's first move</li>\n<li>it must be the rook's first move</li>\n<li>no squares between them are occupied</li>\n<li>the king is not in check</li>\n<li>he king will not move across or end its movement on a square that is under enemy control.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Draws</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes a chess game don't end with a winner but with a draw.</p>\n\n<p>There are 5 reasons why a chess game may end in a draw:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>both players agree to draw</li>\n<li>there are not enough pieces left to force a checkmate</li>\n<li>the same exact position is repeated 3x times</li>\n<li>no pawn was moved and no piece was captured during 50 consecutive moves</li>\n<li>the game is in stalemate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Time Control</h2>\n\n<p>A regular chess clock is used to limit the length of a game.</p>\n\n<p>These clocks count the time that each player separately takes for making his own moves.</p>\n\n<p>If you run out of time, you lose the game.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a

The player throwing the higher number now moves his checkers according to the numbers showing on both dice. After the first roll, the players throw two dice and take alternate turns.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tutorial Video</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/vdnO_3BiprA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n\n<h3>Throwing the dice and moving</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/backgammon/board2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips, the player is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward in the direction indicated in the diagram above.</p>\n\n<p>The following rules apply:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A checker may be moved only to an open point, one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open point, or he may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an open point, but only if the intermediate point (either three or five spaces from the starting point) is also open.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you are lucky you might roll doubles. This is when both dice are the same and means you can move double the amount. For example, if you were to roll 6 and 6 you would be able to move 6 four times and you may move any combination of checkers you feel is best. You lucky sod.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A player must use both numbers of a roll if this is legally possible (or all four numbers of a double). When only one number can be played, the player must play that number.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Or if either number can be played but not both, the player must play the larger one. When neither number can be used, the player loses his turn. In the case of doubles, when all four numbers cannot be played, the player must play as many numbers as he can.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Hitting And Entering</h3>\n\n<p>A point occupied by a single checker is called a blot and if an opposing checker lands on it then this checker is removed from the board and placed on the bar. Therefore it's best to try and keep your checkers in groups of two or more so that they cannot be attacked.</p>\n\n<p>If a player has one or more checkers on the bar, they cannot resume playing until they have succeeded in returning their pieces to the homeboard of their opponent. They do this by rolling a number that corresponds to an open point on the opposing home board.</p>\n\n<p>If white had two checkers on the bar and rolled a 3 and 4 in the first example they could not move and would lose a turn and in the second example they could return both checkers to play and simultaneously remove an opponents checker to the bar.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Bearing Off</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/backgammon/board1.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Once a player has moved all their pieces to their home board, they can start bearing off. A player bears off a checker by rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker resides, and then removing that checker from the board.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, rolling a 4 permits the player to remove a checker from the fourth point.</p>\n\n<p>If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, the player must move instead by moving a checker on a higher point (in the case of rolling a 4, he could move a checker on the fifth or sixth point instead).</p>\n\n<p>If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, the player is permitted (and required) to remove a checker from the highest point on which one of his checkers resides.</p>\n\n<p>A player is under no obligation to bear off if he can make an otherwise legal move.</p>\n\n<p>A player must have all of his active checkers in his home board in order to bear off. If a checker is hit during the bear-off process, the player must bring that checker back to his home board before continuing to bear off. The first player to bear off all fifteen checkers wins the game.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/backgammon/box.png\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The first player to move his or her playing pieces off the board wins the game.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"buy-backgammon.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Each turn consists of a maximum of three rolls.</p>\n\n<p>The first roll must be made with all five dice. If the player chooses to roll a second and, if desired, a third time, he may pick up any or all the dice and roll again.</p>\n\n<p>It is the skillful use of these two optional rolls of the dice that can turn an unlucky first or second roll into a high-scoring turn. A score must be entered after the last roll in the appropriate box or a zero entered in a box of the player's choice.</p>\n\n<p>Each player keeps his own score on a YAHTZEE score card to be marked with the player's name.</p>\n\n<p>To determine who goes first, each player places all five dice in the dice cup and rolls out all the dice; the player with the highest total starts the game.

Otherwise, continue with your 2nd roll.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Your second roll:</h5>\n\n<p>Set aside any keepers' and re-roll the rest.</p>\n\n<p>Hate them all? Re-roll them all.</p>\n\n<p>If you get the exact combo you need, mark your score card. Otherwise, continue with your 3rd roll.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Your third and final roll:</h5>\n\n<p>If you still haven't nailed a combo, or just want to maximize your score:</p>\n\n<p>Roll some or all of your dice (as above), even any keepers you might have set aside.</p>\n\n<p>You must enter a score at the end of this roll, whether or not you like your dice.</p>\n\n<p>If your roll doesn't suit any of your empty boxes, you have to enter a zero somewhere. BUT scoring even a single die value is better than a zero.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Scoring</h2>\n\n<p>There are 13 scoring boxes. On each completed turn, the player must score in one of the 13 boxes. The boxes may be filled in any order, according to the player's best judgment.</p>\n\n<p>The score card has an upper section and a lower section:</p>\n\n<h4>Upper Section</h4>\n\n<p>The upper section contains six boxes labelled 1 to 6 ( \"Aces\", \"Twos\", \"Threes\", \"Fours\", \"Fives\" and \"Sixes\").</p>\n\n<p>When a player chooses to score in the Upper Section, he counts and adds only the dice with the same number and enters the total of these dice in the appropriate box.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game1.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>If a player, on his turn, rolls and elects to take his score in the Upper Section, he would enter 9 in the \"Threes\" box.</p>\n\n<p>But he is also allowed to score a 2 in the \"Twos\" Box or a 4 in the \"Fours\" box. The players can also score a zero in the Aces box.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/score-sheet.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Lower Section</h4>\n\n<p>In the lower section, you score for various combinations and they are played exactly as indicated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h4>3 of a kind</h4>\n\n<p>The \"3 of a kind\" box may be filled in only if the dice show at least 3 of the same number. For example:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game3.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>This would score 18 (total of all dice).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>4 of a kind</h4>\n\n<p>Score the total of all dice provided they include 4 dice of the same number. For example:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game4.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>This would score 14 (total of all dice) in the \"4 of a kind\" box.</p>\n\n<p>(You may also score in \"3 of a kind\" or in the upper section).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Full House</h4>\n\n<p>You need to roll both a \"3 of a kind\" and a pair. A \"Full House\" scores 25 points.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game5.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>(You may also score in \"3 of a kind\" or in the upper section).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Small Straight</h4>\n\n<p>This is any sequence of four numbers, such as:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game6.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The 5th die can be any number. Any \"Small Straight\" is valued at 30 points.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Large Straight</h4>\n\n<p>This is a sequence of five numbers, either:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game7.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>A \"Large Straight\" is valued at 40 points.</p>\n\n<p>(You may also score a Large Straight in the Small Straight box).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Chance</h4>\n\n<p>This offers a player the opportunity to score on any turn where he does not choose to score in any of the other open boxes. Mark score by totalling number of points on all dice.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game9.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>This combination scores 24 points.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Yahtzee</h4>\n\n<p>This is any \"five of a kind\". Score 50 points in the \"Yahtzee\" box.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game8.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box grey4_border\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/yahtzee/game2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>You get a bonus of 35 points if the total number of points you scored in the upper section is 63 or higher.</p>\n\n<p>(For quick calculation, 63 may be reached by scoring 3 \"Aces\", \"Twos\", and so on through \"Sixes\"). A bonus can be obtained by having a total of 63 points or more scored in any manner in the Upper Section</p>\n\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>If you roll multiple Yahtzee, you can rack up a seriously high score.</p>\n\n<p>If you roll a Yahtzee and you already filled in the Yahtzee box with a 50 , you get a 100-point bonus!</p>\n\n<p>Take one bonus chip, then place a checkmark in the Yahtzee bonus box . Then fill in one of the 13 boxes on your score card according to the Joker Rules (see below).</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Joker Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Score the total of all 5 dice in the appropriate Upper Section box.</p>\n\n<p>If this box has already been filled in, score a follows in any open Lower Section Box:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 of a Kind: total of all 5 dice</li>\n<li>4 of a Kind: total of all 5 dice</li>\n<li>Full House: 25 points</li>\n<li>Small Straight: 30points</li>\n<li>Large Straight: 40 points</li>\n<li>Chance: total of all 5 dice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the appropriate Upper Section box and all Lower Section boxes are filled in, you must enter a zero in any open Upper Section box.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"box red_border box_shadow\">\n\n<h3>Play Online</h3>\n\n<p>Do you want to play this great game online now?

The first player to score 500 points wins the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Each player draws a card. Player with the highest point value is the dealer. Shuffle the deck. Each player is dealt 7 cards.</p>\n\n<p>Place the remaining cards facedown to form a draw pile. Turn over the top card of the draw pile to begin a discard pile. If the top card is a Wild or Wild Draw 4, return it to the deck and pick another card. For all other cards, see directions that follow.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Special Cards</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/draw2.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Draw 2 Card</h4>\n\n<p>When you play this card, the next person to play must draw 2 cards and forfeit his/her turn.</p>\n\n<p>If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the first player must draw two cards. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Draw 2 card.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/reverse.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h4>Reverse Card</h4>\n\n<p>This card reverses direction of play. Play to the left now passes to the right, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the player to the right now plays first, and play then goes to the right instead of left.</p>\n\n<p>This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Reverse card.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/skip.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h4>Skip Card</h4>\n\n<p>The next person in line to play after this card is played loses his/her turn and is \"skipped\".</p>\n\n<p>If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the first player (the player to the left of the dealer) is skipped.</p>\n\n<p>This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/wild.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h4>Wild Card</h4>\n\n<p>When you play this card, you may change the color being played to any color (including the current color) to continue play. You may play a Wild card even if you have another playable card in hand.</p>\n\n<p>If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the person to the left of the dealer chooses the color to begin play and plays the first card.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/wild4.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h4>Wild Draw 4 Card</h4>\n\n<p>This card allows you to call the next color played and requires the next player to pick 4 cards from the DRAW pile and forfeit his/her turn. However, there is a hitch!</p>\n\n<p>You can only play this card when you don't have a card in your hand that matches the color of the card previously played. If turned up at the beginning of play, return this card to the deck and pick another card.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> A Player may play a \"Wild Draw Four\" card even if they have a matching number or word card of a different color in their hand. If you suspect that a player has played a Wild Draw 4 card illegally, you may challenge them.</p>\n\n<p>A challenged player must show his/her hand to the player who challenged. If the challenged player is guilty, he/she must draw the 4 cards. If the challenged player is not guilty, the challenger must draw the 4 cards, plus 2 additional cards.</p>\n\n<p>Only the person required to draw the 4 cards can make the challenge.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>What are these extra cards for?</p>\n\n<h4>Blank Card</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/blank.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>This is a special card that you may use in one of two ways. If a card from your UNO deck is lost or damaged you may use the Blank Card as a replacement.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> If you find that your deck is missing one of the yellow 7's you would simply replace it by taking the yellow Blank Card, marking a \"7\" on it and adding it back into the deck.</p>\n\n<p>If your family has a special UNO rule you prefer to play with, you may write that rule on the Blank Cards and add them straight to the deck.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/cards.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Player to the left of the dealer plays first. Play passes to the left to start. Match the top card on the DISCARD pile either by number, color or word.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if the card is a Green 7, you must play a Green card or any color 7. Or, you may play any Wild card or a Wild Draw 4 card. If you don't have anything that matches, you must pick a card from the DRAW pile. If you draw a card you can play, play it.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, play moves to the next person. Before playing your next to last card, you must say \"UNO\". If you don't say UNO and another player catches you with just one card before the next player begins their turn you must pick FOUR more cards from the DRAW pile.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not caught before the next player either draws a card from the DRAW pile or draws a card from their hand to play, you do not have to draw the extra cards. Once a player plays their last card, the hand is over. Points are tallied (see Scoring section) and you start over again.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Going Out</h2>\n\n<p>If you forget to say, \"UNO\" before your card touches the DISCARD pile, but you \"catch\" yourself before any other player catches you, you are safe and not subject to the 4- card penalty.</p>\n\n<p>You may not catch a player for failure to say \"UNO!\" until his/her second-to-last card touches the DISCARD pile. Also, you may not catch a player for failure to say it after the next player begins his/her turn. \"Beginning a turn\" is defined as either drawing a card from the DRAW pile or drawing a card from your hand to play.</p>\n\n<p>If the last card played in a hand is a Draw 2 card or Wild Draw 4 card, the next player must draw 2 or 4 cards, depending upon the card played. These cards are counted when points are totaled.</p>\n\n<p>If no one is out of cards by the time the DRAW pile is depleted, reshuffle the DISCARD pile and continue play.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Scoring</h2>\n\n<p>If you are first to get rid of all your cards, you get points for the cards left in the other players hands. Use the included score pad to record your score after each hand. Each card is worth the following:</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-condensed table-striped border\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>All number cards (0-9)</th><th>Face Value</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Draw 2</td><td>20 Points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Reverse</td><td>20 Points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Skip</td><td>20 Points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wild</td><td>50 Points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wild Draw 4</td><td>50 Points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Blank</td><td>?</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/uno/score.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The <b>winner is the first player to reach 500 points</b>. However, the game may be scored by keeping a running total of the points each player is caught with at the end of each hand.</p>\n\n<p>When one player reaches 500 points, the player with the lowest points is the winner.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Reneging</h2>\n\n<p>You may choose not to play a playable card from your hand. If so, you must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be played, but you may not play a card from your hand after the draw.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Check other UNO Versions</h2>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"angry-birds-game-rules.php\">UNO Angry Birds</a></li><li><a href=\"attack-game-rules.php\">UNO Attack</a></li><li><a href=\"blast-game-rules.php\">UNO Blast</a></li><li><a href=\"boom-o-game-rules.php\">UNO Boom-o</a></li><li><a href=\"bts-game-rules.php\">UNO BTS</a></li><li><a href=\"color-add-game-rules.php\">UNO ColorAdd</a></li><li><a href=\"emoji-game-rules.php\">UNO Emoji</a></li><li><a href=\"dare-game-rules.php\">UNO Dare</a></li><li><a href=\"dice-game-rules.php\">UNO Dice</a></li><li><a href=\"chicago-cubs-game-rules.php\">UNO Chicago Cubs</a></li><li><a href=\"flash-game-rules.php\">UNO Flash</a></li><li><a href=\"flip-game-rules.php\">UNO Flip</a></li><li><a href=\"frozen.php\">UNO Frozen II</a></li><li><a href=\"harry-potter-game-rules.php\">UNO Harry Potter</a></li><li><a href=\"minecraft-game-rules.php\">UNO Minecraft</a></li><li><a href=\"monster-high-game-rules.php\">UNO Monster High</a></li><li><a href=\"mod-game-rules.php\">UNO MOD</a></li><li><a href=\"moo-game-rules.php\">UNO Moo</a></li><li><a href=\"my-first-uno.php\">My First UNO</a></li><li><a href=\"power-grab-game-rules.php\">UNO Power Grab</a></li><li><a href=\"roboto-game-rules.php\">UNO Roboto</a></li><li><a href=\"royal-revenge.php\">UNO Royal Revenge Game</a></li><li><a href=\"the-lion-king.php\">UNO The Lion King</a></li><li><a href=\"spin-game-rules.php\">UNO Spin</a></li><li><a href=\"splash-game-rules.php\">UNO Splash</a></li><li><a href=\"stacko-game-rules.php\">UNO Stacko</a></li><li><a href=\"super-mario-game-rules.php\">UNO Super Mario</a></li><li><a href=\"tippo-game-rules.php\">UNO Tippo</a></li><li><a href=\"unocorns-game-rules.php\">UNO Unocorns</a></li><li><a href=\"wild-jackpot-game-rules.php\">UNO Wild Jackpot</a></li></ul>\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"cards.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

In case of a tie, the player with the lowest score is the winner.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Choose one player to be dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 10 cards, face down, one at a time, to each player. Players hold their 10 cards in hand, so that the other players cannot see them.</p>\n\n<p>Place the remaining deck face down in the center of the play area to become the draw pile. Turn the top card of the draw pile over and place it next to the draw pile, to become the discard pile.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/phase-10/game2.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The player to the left of the dealer plays first. Play continues in a clockwise direction. On your turn, draw one card, either the top card from the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile, and add it to your hand.</p>\n\n<p>End your turn by discarding any one of your cards onto the top of the discard pile. During the play of the first hand, each player tries to complete Phase 1.</p>\n\n<p>A Phase is a combination of cards. Phases are made of sets, runs, cards of all one color, or a combination of sets and runs. These are the ten Phases:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box grey_border\">\n<ol>\n<li>2 sets of 3</li>\n<li>1 set of 3 + 1 run of 4</li>\n<li>1 set of 4 + 1 run of 4</li>\n<li>1 run of 7</li>\n<li>1 run of 8</li>\n<li>1 run of 9</li>\n<li>2 sets of 4</li>\n<li>7 cards of 1 color</li>\n<li>1 set of 5 + 1 set of 2</li>\n<li>1 set of 5 + 1 set of 3</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Each player can make only one Phase during each hand.</p>\n\n<div class=\" notebox\">\n\n<br>\n<h2>Definitions</h2>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Sets</h4>\n\n<p>A set is made of two or more cards with the same number. EXAMPLE: Phase 1 is two sets of three, which could be three \"7s\" and three \"10s\". The two sets could also be the same number, e.g., three \"10s\"and three more \"10s\". The cards may be in any combination of colors.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Runs</h4>\n\n<p>A run is made of four or more cards numbered in order. EXAMPLE: Part of Phase 2 requires a run of four, which could be \"3, \" \"4, ' \"5, \" \"6. \" The cards may be in any combination of colors.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>All One Color</h4>\n\n<p>The cards are all the same color. EXAMPLE: Phase 8 requires seven cards of one color, which could be seven red cards or seven green cards, etc. The cards do not need to be in numerical order.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Wild Cards</h4>\n\n<p>A \"Wild\" card may be used in place of a number card, or may be used as any color, in order to complete a Phase. EXAMPLES: A player wants to make a run of four, but only has cards 3, 4, and 6.</p>\n\n<p>The player uses a \"Wild\" card as a \"5\" to complete the run. Or, a player has 6 green cards, and uses a \"Wild\" card as a green card, to complete Phase 8.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>More than one 'Wild\" card may be used in completing a Phase. Players can use as many 'Wild\" cards as they want as long as they use one natural card.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Once a 'Wild\" card has been played in a Phase, it cannot be replaced by the intended card and used elsewhere, but must remain as that card until the hand is over.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the dealer starts the discard pile with a \"Wild\" card, the card may be picked up by the first player.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Skip Cards</h4>\n\n<p>Skip cards have only one purpose: to cause another player to lose a turn. To use, simply discard the \"Skip\" card on your turn, then choose the player who will lose a turn.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When you draw a \"Skip\" card, you may discard it immediately or save it for a later turn.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A \"Skip\" card may never be used in making a Phase.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A \"Skip\" card may never be picked up from the discard pile.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Only one \"Skip\" card against each player per \"round\" may be used.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When someone is skipped, a \"round\" is once around the table.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the dealer starts the discard pile with a \"Skip\" card, the first player's first turn is automatically skipped.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/phase-10/game5.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Making a Phase</h2>\n\n<p>If, during your turn, you are able to make a Phase with the cards in your hand, lay the Phase down, face-up on the table before discarding. For example, you are trying to make Phase 1.</p>\n\n<p>You have 3 \"5s\" and 2 \"7s\" and you draw another \"7\". You now have 2 sets of 3, and you may lay them down. In the next hand, you will be working on Phase 2.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You must have the whole Phase in hand before laying it down.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You may lay down more than the minimum requirements of a Phase, but only if the additional cards can be directly added to the cards already in the Phase.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p><i>Examples:</i> You lay down 3 \"5s\" and 3 \"7s\" to make Phase 1. You have two more \"5s\" in hand and can immediately lay them down with the 3 \"5s\", all in the same turn. Another player making Phase 1 lays down 3 \"6s\"and 3 \"8s\".</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The player also has 3 \"10s\" in hand, but cannot lay them down because Phase 1 requires exactly 2 sets. Thus, the player can only add more \"6s\" and \"8s\" to the Phase made of \"6s\" and \"8s\".</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Only one Phase can be made per hand.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you successfully make a Phase, then you try to make the next Phase in the next hand. If you fail to make a Phase, you must try to make the same Phase again in the next hand. As a result, players may not all be working on the same Phase in the same hand.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Phases must be made IN ORDER, from 1 to 10. For example, a player trying to make Phase 4(1 run of 7) lays down a run of 9 cards. This qualifies as 1 run of 7 for Phase 4, but cannot be used as credit for either Phase 5 (1 run of 8) or Phase 6 (1 run of 9).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You receive credit for making a Phase as soon as you lay it down. You do not need to win the hand in order to receive credit for the Phase. Several players will often complete a Phase in the same hand.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Hitting</h2>\n\n<p>Hitting is the way to get rid of leftover cards after making a Phase. You make a hit by putting a card directly on a Phase already laid down. The card must properly fit with the cards already down.</p>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p><i>Examples:</i> You may add one or more \"4s\" to a player's existing set of \"4s\". You may add a \"2\" to a player's existing run of \"3\" \"4\", \"5\" \"6\". You may also add a \"7\" and an \"8\" to this run, if you have them.</p>\n\n<p>You may add one or more green cards to a player's seven green cards in Phase 8. You may also add a \"Wild\" card of any color to any of these card situations.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Before you can make a hit, your own Phase must already be laid down. You may hit only during your turn. You may hit your own cards, another player's cards, or both.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Going Out / Finishing a Hand</h2>\n\n<p>After laying down a Phase, players try to \"go out' as soon as possible. To go out, you must get rid of all of your cards, by discarding or hitting on an existing Phase.</p>\n\n<p>The player to go out first wins the hand. The winner of the hand, and any other players who also complete their Phase, will advance to the next Phase for the next hand. Players total</p>\n\n<p>the cards left in their hands. (The fewer cards left in your hand, the better!) All the cards are then shuffled and a new hand begins. (Remember, if you did not complete the Phase before another player went out, you must work on the same Phase again in the next hand).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/phase-10/game3.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Scoring</h2>\n\n<p>You will need paper and pencil to keep a running total for each player. The winner of the hand scores zero. All remaining players score points against them, for cards still in their hands, as follow:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box grey5_bg\">\n<ul>\n<li>5 points for each card numbered 1-9</li>\n<li>10 points for each card numbered 10-12</li>\n<li>15 points for each \"Skip\" card</li>\n<li>25 points for each \"Wild\" card</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Only the cards in a player's hand are scored, not cards already laid down. After the scores are recorded, the player to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer. All cards are gathered and shuffled, and a new hand is dealt.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box green2_border\">\n\n<p>The <b>first player to complete Phase 10</b> at the end of a hand <b>is the winner</b>.</p>\n\n<p>If two or more players complete Phase 10 in the same hand, then the player with the fewest total points is the winner. In the event of a tie, the players that tied replay Phase number 10. The first one to go out is the winner.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"box tucked_corner grey_border\">\n\n<h3>Variations</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>The players play 10 hands. All players advance to the next Phase each time, whether they complete the current Phase or not.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, in hand one players try for Phase 1, then in hand two they all try for Phase 2, etc. After ten hands, the player with the lowest total score is the winner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Players decide how many Phases must be completed in order to win (e.g., 5 Phases or 7 Phases).</p>\n\n<p>The number of Phases to be completed must be decided before play starts. All other rules remain the same. This variation allows for a shorter version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Players decide to play only the even Phases (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) instead of all the Phases. All other rules remain the same.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/phase-10/game1.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"dice.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

In each round, each player chooses one of seven different roles and, thereby, offers all players, in clockwise order, the action associated with that role.</p>\n\n<p><i>For example:</i> with the settler, players can place new plantations, on which, with the help of the craftsman, players can produce goods.</p>\n\n<p>Players can then sell these goods to the trading house with the trader or, with the captain, ship them to the old world. With the money earned from such sales, the players. with the builder, may build buildings in the city, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The player who best manages the changing roles with their associated actions and special privileges, will achieve the greatest prosperity and the highest respect and, thereby, win the game.</p>\n\n<p>The winner is the <b>player who earns the most victory points.</b></p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Place the game board in the middle of the table. Place all the buildings on their assigned spaces on the game board (see below).</p>\n\n<p>Sort the doubloons by value and place them on the bank on the game board (see below).</p>\n\n<p>Each player takes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>1 player board (placed before him on the table)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>money:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with 3 players: 2 doubloons</li>\n<li>with 4 players: 3 doubloons</li>\n<li>with 5 players: 4 doubloons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The players store their doubloons on the windrose on their player boards, so that all players can see how much money each player has.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>1 plantation tile. First, the players choose a starting player using any method they choose. This player takes the governor card and a blue indigo tile (which he places face-up on any of the 12 spaces on his island). The other players take the following in clockwise order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with 3 players: 2nd player: indigo / 3rd player: corn</li>\n<li>with 4 players: 2nd player: indigo / 3rd and 4th players: corn</li>\n<li>with 5 players: 2nd and 3rd players: indigo / 4th and 5th players: corn</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Place the remaining material as shown in the below illustration:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/puerto-rico/setup.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The game is played over several rounds (about 15). Each round is played in the same way. The player with the governor card begins. He takes one of the role cards, places it face-up next to his player board, and takes the action allowed by the role card. Then, his left neighbor takes the action allowed by that role card, and so on around the table, in clockwise order, until every player has taken this action once.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the left neighbor of the governor takes his turn: he takes one of the remaining role cards, places it face-up next to his player board, and takes the action allowed by the role card.</p>\n\n<p>Then, his left neighbor takes the action allowed by that role card, and so on around the table, in clockwise order, until every player has taken this action once. Then, his left neighbor takes a role card, and so on until all players have taken a role card and all players taken the actions allowed by the role cards taken.</p>\n\n<p>Next, place one doubloon on each of the three role cards that were not taken by a player during the round. Then, place the used role cards back on the table next to the unused cards.</p>\n\n<p>The left neighbor of the player with the governor card takes the governor card, becoming the governor for the next round. He begins the round and the game continues as before.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tutorial Video</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/etVx_Aj9UdE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Roles</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"roles.php\">Each role</a> grants the player who takes the card a special privilege, and also, a specific action that can be taken by each player, in clockwise order, starting with the player who took the role (exception: prospector).</p>\n\n<p>Basic rules for all role cards:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If a card has one or more doubloons on it, the player who takes the card gets the doubloons in addition to the privilege and action associated with the card.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The action associated with a role card is always taken first by the player who took the card, followed by the others in clockwise order.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A player must always take a role card when it is his turn to do so, but he may choose not to use the action or privilege of the card he choses. The other players, of course, get their turns at the action of the card.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The action of a role card is optional (exception: captain). A player may choose not to or be unable to use the action on his turn.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A role card remains in front of the player who took it until the end of the round. It may not be taken by another player in the round.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More information about all the <a href=\"roles.php\">roles</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Loading/shipping Rules</h2>\n\n<p>When shipping, players must follow these rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each cargo ship will carry goods of only one kind.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Players may not load goods on a cargo ship if goods of that same kind are on one of the other two cargo ships.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Players may not load goods on a full ship.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>On a player's turn, he must load goods if he can. However, he may only load one kind of goods.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When a player loads goods of a kind, he must load as many of that kind as he can. A player cannot hold back goods when there is space on a ship carrying the kind of goods he has. If a player has a kind of goods that can be loaded on several empty ships, he must choose the ship where he can load the most goods, leaving none behind, if possible.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If a player has several kinds of goods that he can load, he may choose freely, which goods to load. He need not choose the goods that would allow him to load the most barrels.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Victory Points</h2>\n\n<p>For each good (each barrel, not each kind of good) a player loads, he earns one victory point (1 VP) in the form of value 1 victory point chips. When loading goods onto the cargo ships, all kinds of goods have the same value: 1 VP per barrel loaded! The goods values used in the trader phase are not used here.</p>\n\n<p>When loading his first kind of goods, the captain takes as his privilege one extra victory point. He does not get extra VPs for each kind he loads. A player keeps his victory points, unlike his money and goods, secret from the others.</p>\n\n<p>A player puts his victory point chips face-down on his windrose. From time to time, players should convert 5 value 1 chips for a single value 5 chip.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Goods Storage</h2>\n\n<p>When no more goods can be loaded on the cargo ships, the players must store the goods left on their windroses. Each player may store one good (one barrel) on his windrose.</p>\n\n<p>For all other remaining goods, each player must find room in one of his warehouses (small or large). If a player does not have sufficient warehouse space, he must place all extra goods back in the goods supplies (see more information under \"small warehouse\").</p>\n\n<p>As his last duty, the captain unloads all full ships by placing those goods back in their separate supply piles. Partially full and empty ships remain as they are until the next captain phase. It will be more difficult to load goods in the next captain phase, because of the kinds of goods already on the cargo ships and the fewer number of spaces available.</p>\n\n<p>Notes: Remember the special functions of the small and large warehouses, the harbor, and the wharf. If a player cannot store all his extra goods, he may choose which goods to store and which to return to the goods supply. The captain earns only one extra VP as his privilege, regardless of how many kinds of goods he loads. If he loads no goods, he does not get the extra privilege VP.</p>\n\n<p>Players only check for goods storage at the end of the captain phase. Players store goods acquired in other phases on the windroses without limit until the next captain phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The Prospectors</h2>\n\n<p>The player who chooses this role initiates no action, but receives as his privilege 1 doubloon from the bank.</p>\n\n<p>A new round...</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/puerto-rico/prospector.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>After the last player in the round takes a role and all players complete the action, if any, of the role, the round ends. Now, the governor takes three doubloons from the bank, placing one each on the three role cards that were not selected during the round. The doubloons are placed regardless of the number of doubloons already on the cards.</p>\n\n<p>Role cards with more doubloons will be more attractive to the players as they get the doubloons in addition to the privilege of the card. For example, a player choosing a prospector card with 2 doubloons will get, in total, 3 doubloons for his effort.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the players return the role cards they selected to the area next to the game board and the governor gives the governor card to his left neighbor. The new governor begins the next round by selecting a role card, and so the game continues.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/puerto-rico/endgame.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The game ends at the end of the round, in which at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>at the end of the mayor phase there are not enough colonists to fill the colonist ship as required;</li>\n<li>during the builder phase, at least one player builds on his 12th city space;</li>\n<li>during the captain phase, the last of the victory point chips is used.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When the victory point chips are exhausted, players earning victory points thereafter should track them with pencil and paper.</p>\n\n<p>The victory points of the players are now scored with pencil and paper. Each player adds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the value of his VP chips (including those noted on pencil and paper).</li>\n<li>the VP value of his buildings (red-brown number in upper left).</li>\n<li>the extra VPs of his occupied large buildings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> a building scores its victory points even when it is not occupied. Thus, for example, the five large buildings score 4 VP each when they are not occupied.

The map is separated into 6 areas, each with 7 cities. In each game, the playerschoose which areas they will play in. We recommend one area per player. Of course, the areas chosen must be adjacent. During the game, every player can play in all the chosen areas.</p>\n\n<p>Each player takes an overview card, the wooden houses of one color and 50 Elektro. Each player places one of his houses left of the 1 on the scoring track and one on the player order. At the beginning of the game, players draw lots for player order.</p>\n\n<p>The large spaces at the bottom of the board represent the resource market. At the beginning of the game, place 3 coal on spaces 1 to 8; 3 oil on spaces 3 to 8; and 3 garbage on spaces 7 and 8. None of these resources is ever placed on spaces 10 to 16. Place 1 uranium on each of the spaces 14 and 16.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, at the beginning of the game, the cheapest coal costs 1 Elektro, the cheapest oil costs 3 Elektro, the cheapest garbage costs 7 Elektro and the cheapest uranium costs 14. During the game, players will place new supplies of coal, oil, and garbage on spaces 1 to 8 (up to a maximum of three tokens of each per space), and a maximum of 1 uranium token per space on spaces 1 to 16.</p>\n\n<p>Place the remaining resources as a supply near the board. Take the power plant cards numbered 03 to 10 and place them near the board in two horizontal rows. These power plants are an array of 2 x 4 cards (the power plant market). In the upper row, place power plants numbered 03 to 06 in ascending order, left to right, beginning with the least expensive; this is the actual market.</p>\n\n<p>In the lower row, place power plants numbered 07 to 10 in ascending order, left to right; this is the future market. When players add new power plants to the power plant market, players rearrange all power plants in the power plant market in ascending order with the 4 cheapest plants in the actual market.</p>\n\n<p>Remove the »Step 3« card and the ecological power plant number 13 from the card deck, shuffle the remaining power plant cards, and place them face down as a supply stack near the board. Place the »Step 3« card face down under the stack and the ecological power plant number 13 face down on top of the stack.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/usa.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the game</h2>\n\n<p>Each player represents a power company, which works to supply electricity to cities. During the game, each player buys power plants at auction, buys resources to produce electricity in those power plants, and builds a network of cities to supply with electricity from his power plants.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, the player who supplies the most cities with power wins the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The game is played over several rounds. Each round of the game has five phases. In each phase, all players take their actions in the order specified for the phase before the game continues with the next phase. The five phases are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Determine Player Order</li>\n<li>Auction Power Plants</li>\n<li>Buying Resources</li>\n<li>Building</li>\n<li>Bureaucracy</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The game is played in 3 steps (starting with step 1). The steps are not divided into a specific number of rounds. The game moves from »Step 1« to »Step 2« after the first player connected a certain number of cities in his network. »Step 3« begins after the »Step 3« card is drawn. There are minor, but important, rules changes when moving from one step to the next. The game usually ends in »Step 3«, but may end in »Step 2«.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 1: Determine Player Order</h2>\n\n<p>During this phase, the new player order is determined. The first player is the player with the most cities in his network (first house on the scoring track). If two or more players are tied for the most cities, the first player is the player among them with the largest-numbered power plant.</p>\n\n<p>Place this player's house in the first position in the player order area. Determine the remaining player positions using the same rules.</p>\n\n<p><b>Remember:</b> At the beginning of the game draw lots for player order</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Anna already connected 6 cities, Dale and Angelika 5 and Valerie only 4. Anna is first player and places her house in the first position in the player order. Dale and Angelika are tied and check their power plants. Dale owns the 17, Angelika the 15. So Dale is in second position and Angelika in third. Valerie finally places her house in fourth place in the player order.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 2: Auction Power Plants</h2>\n\n<p>In this phase, each player may have an opportunity to offer a power plant for sale at auction. During the phase, each player can buy at most one power plant. A player should try to have plants with enough capacity to power all the cities in his network, but this is not required. The first player starts and chooses between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A. Pass</li>\n<li>B. Choose a power plant for auction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/powerplants.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>A. Pass</h3>\n\n<p>The player may choose not to start an auction and, instead pass. If he does so, he cannot bid in later auctions in this round and, thus, will not get a new power plant this round.</p>\n\n<h3>B. Choose A Power Plant For Auction</h3>\n\n<p>The player chooses one power plant from the actual market (top row) and then makes a bid to purchase it (the player must bid at least the minimum bid (number of the power plant), but may start with a higher bid. Continuing in clockwise order, the other players can make higher bids or pass.</p>\n\n<p>If a player passes, he may not re-enter the current auction. Players keep bidding or passing until one player remains. He pays his highest bid to the bank and takes the power plant.</p>\n\n<p>Players then immediately draw a new card to replace the card sold and place the new card in the market. They rearrange the power plants in ascending order: the four lowest in the actual market, the four highest in the future market.</p>\n\n<h4>Important</h4>\n\n<p>Once a player has purchased a power plant in a round, he cannot bid in another auction in the same round, nor can he offer a plant at auction.</p>\n\n<p>When the auctioning player wins the auction and gets the power plant, the next player in turn order takes his turn at offering a power plant for auction, if he has not already purchased a power plant this round. If he has, the next player in turn order may start an auction, and so on. When a player other than the player who started the auction wins the auction, the auctioning player may choose a new plant to auction from the actual market or pass.</p>\n\n<p>During the game each player can have only 3 power plants at any time. When a player buys a fourth plant, he must discard one of his other power plants.</p>\n\n<p>The player may move resources from the discarded power plant to his remaining three power plants, if they match the resources used by one or more of the retained power plants. If there is no capacity left or no matching power plant for the resources from the discarded plant, the player returns the resources to the supply (not the resource market).</p>\n\n<p>The last player to start an auction in a round can pay just the minimum bid to get the power plant, if he chooses to do so. This is an advantage to being last in this phase.</p>\n\n<p><b>Exception:</b> In the first round of the game, each player must buy a power plant. If, in later rounds, no power plant is sold in a round, the players remove the lowest numbered power plant from the market, placing it back in the box, and replace it by drawing a power plant from the draw stack. They then rearrange the market according to the rules.</p>\n\n<p><b>Exception:</b> Because the player order is chosen randomly at the beginning of the game, the players re-determine the player order after auctioning the power plants (after phase 2). As no player has any cities at this time, the new player order is determined solely by the numbers of the power plants (see phase 1).</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Power Plant Cards</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/powerplantcards.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>1. The number in the upper left corner is the number of the power plant. This number is also the minimum acceptable bid when the plant is auctioned (figure: number and minimum bid of 14).</p>\n\n<p>2. The picture in the middle shows the power plant and has no game related meaning.</p>\n\n<p>3. The symbols in the lower left corner and the color of the bar show, how many resources of a type are required to produce electricity with this plant (brown: coal, black: oil, yellow: garbage, red: uranium). A player can never consume more or fewer resource tokens when using the power plant to produce electricity.</p>\n\n<p>Every power plant can store twice as many resources as it needs to produce. In this example, the power plant needs 2 garbage tokens and can store up to 4 garbage tokens.</p>\n\n<p>4. The number in the house symbol indicates how many cities this power plant can supply with electricity. In this example, the power plant uses exactly 2 garbage tokens and supplies up to 2 cities. A player cannot choose to use just one garbage token with this power plant to supply one city. Although a power plant can store twice as many resources as needed, it cannot produce power for twice as many cities in a round.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/rawmaterials.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Special Power Plants</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/speciapowerplant.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Hybrid Power Plants:</b> These power plants have a brown/black bar and have both coal and oil symbols. The owner of such a power plant can choose to use coal and/or oil. Usually, players will choose the cheaper resource.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> The hybrid power plant 05 (see left) can use 2 coal, 2 oil or 1 coal and 1 oil.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ecological and Fusion Power Plants:</b> These power plants do not require any resources. They can supply up to the number of cities shown in the house symbol.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 3: Buying Resources</h2>\n\n<p>In this phase, the players can buy resources for their power plants from the resource market. A player can only buy resources for plants he owns. A plant cannot produce electricity unless it has enough resources to be fully powered. This phase is played in reverse player order. The last player starts.</p>\n\n<p>Every power plant can store twice as many resources as needed for production. Every power plant only stores the kind of resource it uses for production (a coal power plant stores only coal, a hybrid power plant can store both coal and oil, an ecological power plant never stores resources, etc). Each player can buy resources up to the maximum allowed in all his plants (twice as many as the production numbers of all his plants).</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> The oil power plant 03 can store a maximum of 4 oil, the hybrid power plant 05 a maximum of 4 coal and/or oil in any combination. The ecological power plant 13 does not need any resources and because of that cannot store any resource tokens.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/buyingresources.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Players purchase the resources from the spaces of the resource market. The printed numbers in the resource spaces show the price for one resource token. The players pay the amount owed to the bank. If one kind of resource is depleted, no more of this resource is available for purchase in the current round.</p>\n\n<p><b>Important:</b> At any time during the game, a player can rearrange his resources among his power plants if they are able to use the resources being placed on them.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 4: Building</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/map.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>This phase is played in reverse player order. The last player starts. In this phase, the players start or add cities to their networks on the map. Remember, to win the game a player must be able to power more cities than any other player.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, building a network of cities is essential to winning the game. However, the winner is not necessarily the player with the most cities - it is the player with the most powered cities. Players must balance their power plants with their resources and their networks to win the game.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the game, each player has no cities and, thus, no network. Each player starts his network by choosing any city (not already chosen by another player) in the playing areas (chosen at the beginning of the game) on the map. To show that this city is part of his network, the player places one of his houses on the space numbered 10 in this city.</p>\n\n<p>The player pays the building cost of 10 for the starting city. Depending on what step the game is in, the number of players who can have houses in a city and the cost to build in a city changes (see Steps of the game below).</p>\n\n<p>All subsequent cities a player adds to his network must connect to at least one city already in his network (marked with one of his houses). The player needs only to pay the connecting cost shown on the map (the paths between the new city and one of the cities already in his network) and the value of the lowest empty city space.</p>\n\n<p>When connecting to a new city, the player chooses the cheapest connection berween the new andone of his own cities and pays the total costs to the bank. A player may connect to any number of new cities in a round, as long as he can pay the building and connecting costs.</p>\n\n<p>The following rules are valid for connecting cities to the player's networks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In step 1 of the game, each city can only connected by one player, in step 2 by two players and in step 3 by three players. When adding the city the player pays 10 for placing the first house in a city, 15 for placing the second house, and 20 for placing the third house additionally to the connection costs between the cities.</li>\n<li>A player may add any city (if there is room in the city for the player) to his network, regardless of its distance from his other cities. The player may build through a city without placing a house there if he wants or (more likely) if there is no room in the city.</li>\n<li>A player may never connect to the same city twice.</li>\n<li>After connecting a city, the player places one of his houses in the new city on the lowest empty space (10, 15 or 20 Elektro).</li>\n<li>A player can only expand his network; he cannot start a second network on the map. A player always must pay all connecting and building costs, even if he already used a connection earlier during the game.</li>\n<li>A city may only be connected to a mximum of three different networks (see below for the beginning of the different steps of the game).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/duisburg.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Anna can expand her network from Duisburg to Essen for 10 Elektro because there are no connecting costs between Duisburg and Essen. To add Dortmund, she must pay 12 Elektro (10+2) if she uses the cheaper connection from Münster. To connect to Aachen the complete costs are 21 Elektro (10+9+2), because she has to pay the connection through Düsseldorf.</p>\n\n<p>For Bob, the connection costs to Duisburg are also cheap. For 12 Elektro (10+2+0), he can build the connection through Essen.</p>\n\n<p>If the game is in step 2, Anna can add Düsseldorf for 17 Elektro (15+2) or Köln for 21 Elektro (15+2+4). In step 2, second houses in cities are allowed (see Steps of the game below).</p>\n\n<p>If Anna adds both Düsseldorf and Köln, she pays 36 Elektro. First, she adds Düsseldorf for 17 Elektro and, then, from there, she adds Köln for an additional 19 Elektro.</p>\n\n<h4>Important</h4>\n\n<p>The players do not have to choose their starting cities in the first round. They can start their networks in later rounds to influence their positions in the playing order.</p>\n\n<p>When a player adds a new city to his network, he immediately updates his position on the scoring track so every player can see how many cities each player has.</p>\n\n<p>If, at any time during the game, there is a power plant in the actual market with a number equal to or lower than the number of cities any player has, players immediately remove it from the game and replace it with a new card from the draw stack. This rule does not affect power plants owned by players.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> A player adds a city and now has 6 cities in his network. If the power plant numbered 06 is still in the actual power plant market, he removes it from the game, but the players keep their power plants numbered 03 to 05. Then, he draws a new card from the draw stack, adding it to the power plant market, using the normal rules for adding plants to the market. It is also possible that newly drawn power plants must be immediately discarded and a new card drawn.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 5: Bureaucracy</h2>\n\n<p>In this phase, the players earn cash, re-supply the resource market, and remove a power plant from the power plant market, replacing it with a new one from the stack.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/money.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><b>Earning cash:</b> Starting with the first player, every player indicates how many cities in his network he wishes (and is able) to supply with electricity. He earns cash based on the number of cities he powers as shown on the payment table. A player who does not supply any city gets 10 Elektro (the guaranteed minimum).</p>\n\n<p>The players remove the required resources from the power plants that produced electricity this round and place the used resources in the resource supply next to the board. A player may choose (or only be able) to supply fewer cities than he has in his network.</p>\n\n<p>The player is paid only for the supplied cities. If a player produces more electricity than he has cities in his network, the surplus is wasted. Every player can choose how many and which of his power plants he uses, e.g. he does not have to supply all of his cities.</p>\n\n<h3>Payment</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/payment.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><b>Re-supply the resource market:</b> Based on the number of players and the step of the game, the players re-supply the resource market (see table at the back of the rules) from the supply of resources. They start placing the resources on the highest (most expensive) space lacking the maximum possible quantity of the appropriate resource.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: Uranium must be refilled from space 16 and always only with one token in each space.</p>\n\n<p>If there are not enough resources left in the supply, that resource is not fully re-supplied! This might happen, if the players store too many resources in their power plants.</p>\n\n<p>The resource tokens in the game are limited.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/example.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>According to the table, the following resources are to be re-supplied for 5 players in step 1: 5 coal, 4 oil, 3 garbage, and 2 uranium. As there are only 4 coal tokens left in the supply (the rest are stored on power plants), the players place only these four coal tokens: 1 on space 4 and 3 on space 3.</p>\n\n<p>The players place 2 oil tokens on space 3 and 2 oil tokens on space 2. The players place 1 garbage token on space 7 and 2 garbage tokens on space 6. They place 1 uranium token each on spaces 12 and 10.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to the first round there is now a higher price for coal (now 3 Elektro), but oil is cheaper (now only 2 Elektro).</p>\n\n<p><b>Update the power plant market:</b> Place the highest numbered power plant from the future market face down under the draw stack and draw a new one to replace it. Rearrange the market appropriately (see phase 2: this will change in Step 3, see the steps of the game). Because of this, the highest numbered power plants are collected under the »Step 3« card and become available during step 3 in the game.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 5 and the whole round are now complete. A new round starts with phase 1.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The Steps of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>This chapter describes the different rules changes for the three steps. Step means the different gaming steps during the game, phase means the 5 phases in one round.</p>\n\n<h3>Step 1</h3>\n\n<p>The game starts. In step 1, every city can have only one house. The building cost for the first house is 10 Elektro. The resource table on the back of the rules shows the re-supply numbers for step 1.</p>\n\n<h3>Step 2</h3>\n\n<p>Step 2 starts before phase 5 (bureaucracy) after a player has built his 7th city during phase 4 (Building). It can be that several players will build their 7th cities in the same round or a player may have built more than 7 cities in this round.</p>\n\n<p>To start step 2, remove ONCE the lowest numbered power plant from the game and replace it with a new one from the draw stack, rearranging the market as always.</p>\n\n<p>From now on in step 2, two players can have houses in each city. The building price for the second connection is 15 Elektro. Please check the tables for the changed re-supply of resources for step 2.</p>\n\n<h3>Step 3</h3>\n\n<p>When the »Step 3« card is drawn from the draw stack, step 3 begins at the beginning of the subsequent phase of the game. This can happen in one of three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>If the »Step 3« card is drawn in phase 2 (Auction Power Plants), treat the card as the highest power plant and place it at the end of the future market. Immediately shuffle the draw stack with the remaining power plants (the power plants that were placed under the draw stack during steps 1 and 2 of the game), and place it face down next to the game board.</p>\n\n<p>Continue the auction of power plants and draw replacements as necessary until all players have their chance to buy a new power plant or pass. After finishing phase 2, remove the lowest numbered power plant and the »Step 3« card from the market and do not draw replacements! Step 3 starts in phase 3.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>If the »Step 3« card is drawn in phase 4 (Building) for replacements of too small power plants, remove this card and the smallest numbered power plant from the game and do not draw replacements. Shuffle the draw stack with the remaining power plants and place it face down next to the game board. Step 3 starts in phase 5</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>If the »Step 3« card is drawn in phase 5 (Bureaucracy), remove this card and the lowest numbered power plant from the game and do not draw replacements. Shuffle the draw stack with the remaining power plants and place it face down next to the game board. Use the re-supply of resources for Step 2 a final time. Step 3 starts in phase 1 of the next turn.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>During step 3, there are only 6 power plants in the power plant market and all of these power plants are in the actual market and are available to be auctioned (there is no future market in step 3).</p>\n\n<p>In step 3, every city can have three houses. The building price for the third house is 20 Elektro. Please check the tables for the changed re-supply of resources.</p>\n\n<p>In phase 5 in following rounds of step 3: remove the smallest numbered power plant from the game and draw a replacement from the draw stack. During the last rounds of the game, it is possible that the draw stack becomes exhausted.</p>\n\n<p>The game continues and in each phase 5, the players remove the smallest numbered power plant. It is possible to run out of power plants if this goes on for several rounds.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/box.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The game ends immediately after phase 4 when at least one player has at least 17 cities in his network. No player can buy more resources or power plants at this time!</p>\n\n<p>The winner is the player who can supply electricity to the most cities in his network with the power plants and resources he has.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a tie, the player with the most remaining money wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the most cities in his network is the winner.</p>\n\n<p><b>Important:</b> Sometimes (not rarely) a player other than one with 17 or more cities will win because the latter cannot supply electricity to all his cities, either because his power plants are not large enough to run all his cities or because he does not have sufficient resources to run the power plants he has.</p>\n\n<p>This reinforces the need for players to balance their power plants, resources, and networks.</p>\n\n<h4>Exceptions, Changes, And Special Things</h4>\n\n<p>Depending on the number of players some details of the game change. A summary is shown in the following table. For example you need fewer power plants for 2 players, but both of them can own up to 4 power plants.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/power-grid/exceptions.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"power-grid-factory-manager-rules.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

During the course of the game, these families have abundant possibilities to improve their quality of life by building up their home, improving their fields and breeding their animals.</p>\n\n<p>In each of the game's 14 rounds, each of a player's Family members may take exactly one action. They can generate building resources such as Wood and Clay, add more people to their family, and ensure that they are fed.</p>\n\n<p>In each round, each action can only be taken by one Person - players will miss out if another player chooses the action first. A new action becomes available in each round - see Overview of game phases.</p>\n\n<p>You must plan to grow your family at the right time - but not too soon, because even the next generation must be fed. Growing your family is important, though, because it allows you to take more actions as they become available. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has established the best farmyard.</p>\n\n<p>Victory points are awarded for the number of fields, pastures and fenced stables, as well as for Grain, Vegetables, Sheep, Wild boar and Cattle. Players lose one point for each unused farmyard space. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family's home, for the number of Family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards. There are examples of play, with explanations, on the reverse sides of three of the boards.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Place the three game boards as shown in the illustration to the right. Each player chooses a color and takes the playing pieces in that color, as well as one farmyard.</p>\n\n<p>These are placed in front of the player (facing whichever direction the player chooses). On each of the two building spaces on this farmyard, players first place a Wooden hut room tile and then (in each of these rooms) one of their Family members.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining playing pieces (additional Family members, fences and stables) remain in the bag for now or are placed to one side. Sort the remaining house and hut tiles and the rest of the game components and place them beside the playing area.</p>\n\n<p>Sort the cards according to the color of the reverse side. Depending on the number of players, different green Action cards (B) are used. There are also blue Round cards (A), yellow Occupation cards (C), orange \"Minor Improvement\" cards (D), red \"Major Improvement\" cards (E), grey Begging cards (F)) and Summary cards (G).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/agricola/blue.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li><p>Sort the blue Round cards according to the Stage of the game. Shuffle each small pile and place the piles on top of each other with the cards for Stage 6 at the bottom, Stage 5 on top of that, etc - finishing with the four cards for Stage 1 on the top. The Round cards make new actions available during the game.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you are playing with 3, 4 or 5 players, take the corresponding set of green Action cards and place them face up on the spaces to the left of the first game board. The order in which the cards are laid out is irrelevant. In a 3-player game, there are 4 cards, in 4- and 5-player games there are 6 cards. In solo and 2-player games, no green Action cards are used.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/agricola/yellow.jpg\" class=\"floatr\"> The purple symbol on the left side of the yellow Occupation cards shows how many players the card is used for: means for 1-5 players, for 3-5 players, for 4-5 players. Cards that are not in use are removed from the game; the full deck of Occupation cards is only available in a 4- or 5-player game. Shuffle the cards. Each player is dealt a hand of 7 Occupation cards and may look through them. The remaining Occupation cards are put to one side.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Shuffle the orange Minor Improvement cards. Each player is dealt a hand of 7 Minor Improvement cards and may look through them. The remaining Minor Improvement cards are put to one side.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/agricola/red.jpg\" class=\"floatr\"> Place the 10 red Major Improvement cards face up on the Major Improvements board. As soon as 9 Major Improvements have been bought, the board is turned over to show the scoring overview and the remaining Major Improvement is placed on the space on the reverse of the board.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Place the grey Begging cards face-up beside the playing area.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Each player takes a Summary card and places it in their playing area. One side of the card gives an overview of the game phases; the other explains the scoring at the end of the game. There are no scoring rounds during the game.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/agricola/action6.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Players choose a starting player who receives the Starting player marker and 2 Food. The other players each receive 3 Food.</p>\n\n<p>The Starting player marker is not automatically passed on to the next player at the end of a round: it passes to the player who chooses the \"Starting player\" action.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tutorial Video</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIkxqjuQuOE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The game consists of six stages, which are divided into 14 rounds.</p>\n\n<p>Each round follows the same pattern and consists of four phases. There is a Harvest at the end of each stage (after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14). This is shown on the game boards as Harvest.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Phase 1: Start The Round, Draw A New Round Card</h3>\n\n<p>Turn over the top Round card and place it on the appropriate space on the board. The action on this card is available to all players, and can be used not only in this round but in all subsequent rounds.</p>\n\n<p>All actions which occur at the beginning of a particular round or at the beginning of every round occur now.</p>\n\n<p>The text on some cards instructs players to place items on the Round card spaces. If there are tiles, Food and/or other playing pieces on the space for the current round, these are distributed to the appropriate players (who earned them by playing an Occupation or Improvement).</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 2: Replenish, Place New Goods And Animals</h3>\n\n<p>Place new goods and Food on any Action spaces on the board that require them (on the printed spaces as well as on Action and Round cards). These spaces are shown by an arrow.</p>\n\n<p>If goods or Food are already on a space, the new goods/Food are added to them.</p>\n\n<p>3 Wood means that 3 Wood tokens are placed on that space each round, 1 Cattle means that 1 Cattle token is placed on the space each round, etc. The Fishing and Traveling Players Action spaces receive 1 Food each round. These goods and Food are taken from the general supply and can build up over several rounds - there is no upper limit.</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 3: Work Phase</h3>\n\n<p>In clockwise order, starting with the Starting player, players take turns taking a single Family member from their farmyard, placing it on an unoccupied Action space and taking that action. Play continues until all Family members have been placed. A player may only ever place one Family member at a time. Each Action space can only be used by one Person in one round.</p>\n\n<p>A Family member may never occupy an Action space without performing its action.</p>\n\n<p>Some Action spaces offer players several choices of action or require a player to take one action before (optionally) taking a second action. Whenever a player takes building resources, Grain, Vegetables or Food, the tokens are placed in a player's personal supply in view of the other players. Animals may not be placed in the supply; they must be placed directly into the farmyard.</p>\n\n<p>Animals that cannot be placed into the farmyard must be returned to the general supply or immediately transformed into Food using an Improvement with the cooking symbol. A player who plays a card from their hand or buys a Major Improvement must read the text on the card aloud so that all the other players are aware of its effects.</p>\n\n<p>Players are not allowed to hide their personal supply from other players or to completely cover cards that they have played.</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 4: Return Home</h3>\n\n<p>Players remove their Family members from the game boards and return them to their home.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Harvest Time</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/agricola/harvest.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Players feed their Family members during the Harvest, which occurs at the end of each stage of the game (see Appendix, section 6) - that is, after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14 . The Harvest consists of three phases, which occur one after another.</p>\n\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h3>Harvest Phase 1: The Field Phase</h3>\n\n<p>Players remove 1 Grain or Vegetable token from each Sown field in their farmyard and place them in their personal supply. Players may also receive additional Food from Occupation or Improvement cards that they have played.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h3>Harvest Phase 2: Feeding The Family</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of this phase, each player must feed his or her family by paying 2 Food per Family member. Offspring that were born during the current round (\"Newborn offspring\", typically from a Family growth action) only consume 1 Food for this round, but will require 2 Food in future Harvests.</p>\n\n<p>Each unprocessed Grain or Vegetable may be converted to 1 Food at any time. Fireplaces and Cooking Hearths, as well as other specific Occupations and Improvements, allow players to convert Vegetables at any time, at a better exchange rate.</p>\n\n<p>Improvements with the cooking symbol can be used to convert animals to Food at any time. Improvements with the bread symbol can be used to Bake bread, but only when the player takes a Bake bread action during a round. Unprocessed animals have no Food value.</p>\n\n<h3>Begging</h3>\n\n<p>A player who cannot or does not wish to produce the required Food must take a Begging card for each missing Food - players may not give up members of their family to avoid the need to Feed them. At the end of the game, players lose 3 points for each Begging card.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h3>Harvest Phase 3: Breeding</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/agricola/breeding.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Lastly, any player with at least 2 animals of the same type receives exactly one additional (baby) animal of that type - but only if the lamb, the shoat (piglet) or the calf can be accommodated in the farmyard (or on an appropriate Improvement card, for example the \"Animal Yard\", \"Wildlife Reserve\" or \"Forest Pasture\").</p>\n\n<p>Baby animals and parent animals may not be converted into Food immediately after the birth (for example, if you only have room for two animals of that type); they simply run away if they cannot be accommodated.</p>\n\n<p>The animals breed regardless of where the parent animals are placed.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/agricola/box.png\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The game ends after the Harvest at the end of the 14th round (Stage 6), after which the <a href=\"scoring.php\">player's scores are calculated</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tally each player's Victory Points on the scoring sheet. The player with the most points is the winner.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a tie, the tied players share the victory (or can play another game of Agricola to break the tie).</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"actions.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

This is called the Character Deck.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the remaining district cards together into one deck. This is called the District Deck.</p>\n\n<p>Each player is then dealt four random district cards from the District Deck and each player receives two gold from the bank.</p>\n\n<p>The oldest player receives the Crown.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/citadels/setup.png\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Citadels is played over a series of rounds; each round has four steps.</p>\n\n<h3>Step One: Remove Characters</h3>\n\n<p>First draw one random card from the Character Deck and set it facedown in the center of the table without looking at it. This card will not be used this round.</p>\n\n<p>Then draw a second set of cards from the Character Deck and set them faceup in the middle of the table (the number of such faceup cards depends on the number of players). These faceup cards will not be used this round.</p>\n\n<p>Special Rule: If you draw the King character to be faceup, immediately replace it with another random card from the Character Deck, and then shuffle the King back into the Character Deck.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/citadels/special-rule.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Step Two: Choose Characters</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/citadels/characters.png\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The player who currently possesses the Crown now takes the Character Deck, looks at the cards, and secretly chooses a character from those available. He then passes the remaining character cards to the player on his left, who also secretly chooses a card and passes the remaining cards to the left, etc.</p> <p>This process continues until each player has chosen one card from the Character Deck. After the last player has chosen, the single remaining unchosen card is placed facedown in the center of the table.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Step Three: Player Turns</h3>\n\n<p>Once all players have chosen a character card, the player who has the Crown now calls out the name of each character one-at-a-time in the order of numerical rank. In this way, he first calls out the \"Assassin\" (#1), then the \"Thief\" (#2), etc. If no player reveals that character when called, simply call out the next character in rank order.</p>\n\n<p>When the name of your character card is called, you must reveal your character card, place it faceup in front of you, and take your turn. When your turn is over, the player with the Crown calls the name of the next character card. In this manner, play proceeds to every character in order of their rank number, giving all players one turn (unless murdered by the Assassin, of course).</p>\n\n<p>On your turn, you must first take an action, after which you may build a district card.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Take an Action</h4>\n\n<p>At the beginning of your turn, you must do one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Take two gold from the bank, or</li>\n<li>Draw two district cards from the District Deck, choose one card to put in your hand, and place the other card on the bottom of the District Deck.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li><h4>Build a District Card</h4>\n\n<p>After you have taken an action, you may build one district card in your city (that is, play it from your hand onto the table in front of you). In order to do so, you must pay the cost of the district, in gold, to the bank. You may choose not to build a district card if you wish.</p>\n\n<p>The gold cost of building a district card is equal to the number of gold coins printed on the upper left-hand side of the card.</p>\n\n<p>You may not build a district such that you have two identical districts (two \"Castle\" cards, two \"Market\" cards, etc). in your city.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/citadels/cards.png\"><br><br>\n\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Characters and Their Special Abilities</h4>\n\n<p>Each character has a special ability, also called its power. You may use your character's power once during your turn. Each character's special power is summarized on its respective card and explained in detail at the end of these rules. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the detailed powers before playing your first game.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Step Four: End of Round</h3>\n\n<p>After all the characters have been called, each player returns his character card to the Character Deck, which is shuffled, and a new round begins.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/citadels/box.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When a player builds his eighth district, the game ends after the current round is completed. Use this scoring process to determine how many points each player receives:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>A player receives a number of points equal to the total combined gold cost of all the district cards in his city at the end of the game.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If a player has at least one district in each of the five colors, he receives three points.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If a player was the first player to build eight districts, he receives four points.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>All other players who have managed to build eight districts at the end of the game receive two points.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The winner of the game is the player with the most points. In the case of a tie, compare the total points received only from step 1 of the above scoring process. If there is still a tie, the player with the most gold wins.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Players may build more than eight districts in their city if they have the means to do so.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"characters.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Game Rules</h1></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"post-thumbnail\"><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/bang.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n\n\n<p>BANG! is a shootout game, in Spaghetti Western style, between a group of Outlaws and the Sheriff, who is their primary target.</p>\n\n<p>The Deputies incognitos help the Sheriff, but there is also a Renegade pursuing his own goal! In BANG! each player plays one of these roles, and represents a famous Wild West inspired character.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/components.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n<ul>\n<li>7 Roles: 1 Sheriff, 2 Deputies,<br>3 Outlaws, 1 Renegade</li>\n<li>16 Characters</li>\n<li>7 Summary cards</li>\n<li>80 Playing cards</li>\n<li>30 Bullets</li>\n<li>7 Playing boards;</li>\n<li>Instructions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box grey4_border box_shadow\">\n\n<p>Each player has his own goal:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game8.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p><b>Sheriff:</b> must eliminate all the Outlaws and the Renegade, to protect law and order.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game8_.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p><b>Outlaws:</b> they would like to kill the Sheriff, but they have no scruples \" about eliminating each other to gain rewards!</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game9_.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p><b>Deputies:</b> they help and protect the Sheriff, and share his same goal, W at all costs!</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game9.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p><b>Renegade:</b> he wants to be the new Sheriff; his goal is to be the last character in play.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>(Before the first game remove carefully the bullet tokens from their frames). Each player takes a playing board (place it in front of you to hold your role, your character, your weapon and your bullets).</p>\n\n<p>Take as many role cards as the number of players, divided as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>4 players:</b> Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws</li>\n<li><b>5 players:</b> Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws, 1 Deputy</li>\n<li><b>6 players:</b> Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 1 Deputy</li>\n<li><b>7 players:</b> Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Shuffle the cards reveals himself by turning his card face up. All other players look at their role but keep it secret.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game10.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Shuffle the characters and give one face up to each player. Each player now announces the name of his character and reads his ability. Each player takes as many bullets as shown on his character.</p>\n\n<p>The Sheriff plays the game with one additional bullet: if his character card shows three bullets, he is considered for all effects to have four; if he has four bullets, then the Sheriff plays with five.</p>\n\n<p>Put the remaining roles, boards and character cards back in the box.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the playing cards, and give each player as many cards, face down, as the bullets he has. Put the remaining playing cards face down in the middle of the table, as a draw pile. Leave room for the discard pile.</p>\n\n<div class=\" notepad\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game12.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> for your first few games, you can try a simplified version of the game by removing all cards with the symbol of a book before getting started.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Characters</h4>\n\n<p>Each Western character has some special abilities, which make you unique. The bullets you have show how many life points you begin the game with, i.e. how many times you can be hit before being eliminated from play.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the bullets indicate how many cards the player can hold in his hand at the end of his turn (hand size limit).</p>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Jesse Jones has 4 life points: he can be hit four times before being eliminated from the game. Moreover, he can hold up to four cards in his hands at the end of his turn.</p>\n\n<p>If during game Jesse loses one life point and he is down at 3, he can only hold up to three cards in his hand at the end of his turn. But fear not! Life points can be recovered!</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The Sheriff begins. The game is played in turns, in clockwise order. Each player's turn is divided into three phases:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow2_border\">\n<ol>\n<li>Draw two cards;</li>\n<li>Play any number of cards;</li>\n<li>Discard excess cards.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>1. Draw two cards</h2>\n\n<p>Draw the top two cards from the draw pile. As soon as the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to create a new playing deck.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>2. Play any number of cards</h2>\n\n<p>Now you may play cards to help yourself or hurt the other players, trying to eliminate them. You can only play cards during your turn (exception: Missed! and Beer, see below).</p>\n\n<p>You are not forced to play cards during this phase. You can play any number of cards; there are only three limitations:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow2_border\">\n<ul>\n<li>you can play only 1 BANG! card per turn; (this applies only to BANG! cards, not to cards with the symbol)</li>\n<li>you can have only 1 copy of any one card in play; (one card is a copy of another if they have the same name)</li>\n<li>you can have only 1 weapon in play. (when you play a new weapon, discard the one you have in play)</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> If you put a Barrel in play, you cannot play another one, since you would end up having two copies of the same card in front of you.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>There are two types of cards: brown-bordered cards (= play and discard) and blue-bordered cards (= weapons and other objects).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game13.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<b>\n\n</b><p><b>Brown-bordered cards</b> are played by putting them directly into the discard pile and applying the effect described with text or with symbols on the cards (illustrated in the next paragraphs).</p>\n\n<p><b>Blue-bordered cards</b> are played face up in front of you (exception: Jail). Blue cards in front of you are hence defined to be \"in play\".</p>\n\n<p>The effect of these cards lasts until they are discarded or removed somehow (e.g. through the play of a Cat Balou), or a special event occurs (e.g. in the case of Dynamite). There is no limit on the cards you can have in front of you provided that they do not share the same name.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>3. Discard Excess Cards</h2>\n\n<p>Once the second phase is over (you do not want to or cannot play any more cards), then you must discard from your hand any cards exceeding your hand-size limit.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that your hand size limit, at the end of your turn, is equal to the number of bullets (i.e. life points) you currently have.</p>\n\n<p>Then it is the next player's turn, in clockwise order.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Distance Between Players</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game14.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The distance between two players is the minimum number of places between them, counting clockwise or counterclockwise (see figure). The distance is very important, because all cards with a sight take it into account.</p>\n\n<p>Normally you can reach only targets (players or cards) within a distance of 1 (note the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game11.jpg\"> of your Colt .45 on your playing board).</p>\n\n<p>When a character is eliminated, he is no longer counted when evaluating the distance: some players will get \"closer\" when someone is eliminated.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Eliminating a character</h3>\n\n<p>When you lose your last life point, you are eliminated and your game is over, unless you immediately play a Beer (see below).</p>\n\n<p>When you are eliminated from the game, show your role card and discard all the cards you have in hand and in play.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Penalties and Rewards</h3>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow2_border\">\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the Sheriff eliminates a Deputy, the Sheriff must discard all the cards he has in hand and in play.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Any player eliminating an Outlaw (even if the eliminating player is himself an Outlaw!) must draw a reward of 3 cards from the deck.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>the Sheriff is killed. If the Renegade is the only one alive, then he wins. Otherwise, the Outlaws win;</p></li>\n\n<li><p>all the Outlaws and the Renegade are killed. The Sheriff and his Deputies win.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p><i>Example 1:</i> All the Outlaws are eliminated, but the Renegade is still in play. In this case, the game continues. The Renegade must now face the Sheriff and his Deputies alone.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example 2:</i> The Sheriff is killed, but all Outlaws are eliminated, and one Deputy and the Renegade are still in play. The game ends with the Outlaws winning! They achieved their goal at the cost of their own lives!</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<h4>New Game</h4>\n\n<p>If you play more than one game in a row, players still \"alive\" at the end of the game may choose to keep their character (but not the cards in hand or in play!) for the following game; players which have been eliminated must draw a new character randomly.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to give each player the opportunity of playing the Sheriff, you may decide, before starting the game, to pass this role among players from game to game, randomly assigning the other roles.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you are familiar with the rules, let's see the cards of BANG! in detail!</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"infobox\"><div class=\"info-icon info-icon3\"><i></i></div><div class=\"infobox-body\">\n\n<h3>Remember</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Any card with a Missed! symbol can be used to cancel the effect of a card with a BANG! symbol</li>\n<li>you can only play one BANG! card per turn, but you can play any number of other cards which show the symbol</li>\n<li>you cannot have two cards with the same name in front of you</li>\n<li>you can only have one weapon in play, but at least you always have a Colt .45</li>\n<li>weapons do not change the distance between players, they represent only your shooting range</li>\n<li>Beer has no effect when there are only 2 players left in the game</li>\n<li>when you are losing your last life point, you can only play a Beer, and not a Saloon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Curiosity</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/bang/game59.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>In order to keep track of your life points, you can use another character card, from the ones left over. Turn it face down and cover / uncover the bullets by sliding your character card on it, just like in the picture.</p>\n\n<p>This makes easier to bring BANG! with you and play it anywhere!</p>\n\n<p><i>Jesse Jones with three life points.</i></p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"cards.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

You need at least four players (two teams of two) for a standard game.</p>\n\n<p>Each team chooses one player to be their spymaster. Both spymasters sit on the same side of the table. The other players sit across from their spymasters.</p>\n\n<p>They are field operatives.</p>\n\n<p>Randomly choose 25 codenames and place them on the table in a 5-by-5 grid.</p>\n\n<p>Note: While shuffling the codename cards, be sure to flip over half the deck once in a while. This will mix the words more thoroughly.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The key</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/key.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Each game has one key that reveals the secret identities of the cards on the table. The spymasters should choose the key card randomly and slide it into the stand between them.</p>\n\n<p>Any side can be up. Don't think about it. Just slide it into the stand. And don't let the field operatives see it.</p>\n\n<p>The key corresponds to the grid on the table. Blue squares correspond to words that Blue Team must guess (blue agents). Red squares correspond to words that Red Team must guess (red agents).</p>\n\n<p>Pale squares are innocent bystanders, and the black square is an assassin who should never be contacted at all.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Starting team</h2>\n\n<p>The four lights around the edge of the key card indicate which team starts. The starting team has 9 words to guess. The other team has 8. The starting team will give the first clue of the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Agent cards</h2>\n\n<table>\n\n<tbody><tr><td width=\"300\"><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/red.jpg\" class=\"board\"><br><span class=\"fontbig\">8 red agents</span></td>\n\n<td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/blue.jpg\" class=\"board\"><br><span class=\"fontbig\">8 blue agents</span></td></tr>\n\n</tbody></table><br><br>\n\n<p>The red agent cards go in a stack in front of the red spymaster. The blue agent cards should be in front of the blue spymaster. This helps everyone remember which team they are on.</p>\n\n<div class=\"fontbig\"><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/double-agent.jpg\" class=\"board\"><br>1 double agent</div>\n\n<p>The double agent belongs to whichever team starts. Flip it to that team's color. It will be one of that team's agent cards for the duration of the game.</p>\n\n<table class=\"\">\n\n<tbody><tr><td width=\"300\"><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/innocent.jpg\" class=\"board\"><br><span class=\"fontbig\">7 innocent bystanders </span></td>\n\n<td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/assassin.jpg\" class=\"board\"><br><span class=\"fontbig\">1 assassin</span></td></tr>\n\n</tbody></table><br><br>\n\n<p>The innocent bystander cards and the assassin should be kept in between, where both spymasters can reach them easily.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tutorial Video</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CgIEasXPiuU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Teams take turns. The starting team is indicated by the 4 lights on the edges of the key card.</p>\n\n<h3>Giving a clue</h3>\n\n<p>If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue that relates to some of the words your team is trying to guess. When you think you have a good clue, you say it. You also say one number, which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your clue.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Two of your words are NUT and BARK. Both of these grow on trees, so you say tree: 2.</p>\n\n<p>You are allowed to give a clue for only one word (cashew: 1 ) but it's fun to try for two or more. Getting four words with one clue is a big accomplishment.</p>\n\n<h4>One Word</h4>\n\n<p>Your clue must be only one word. You are not allowed to give extra hints. For example, don't say, \"This may be a bit of a stretch…\" You are playing Codenames. It's always a bit of a stretch.</p>\n\n<p>Your clue cannot be any of the codenames visible on the table. On later turns, some codenames will be covered up, so a clue that is not legal now might be legal later.</p>\n\n<h3>Making contact</h3>\n\n<p>When the spymaster gives a clue, his or her field operatives try to figure out what it means. They can debate it amongst themselves, but the spymaster must keep a straight face.</p>\n\n<p>The operatives indicate their official guess when one of them touches one of the codenames on the table.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>If the field operative touches a card belonging to his or her team, the spymaster covers the word with an agent card in that color. The team may guess another word.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the field operative touches an innocent bystander, the spymaster covers it with an innocent bystander card. This ends the turn.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the field operative touches a card belonging to the other team, the word is covered by one of the other team's agent cards. This ends the turn. (And it helps the other team).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the field operative touches the assassin, the word is covered by the assassin card. This ends the game! The team that contacted the assassin loses.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tip: Before saying your clue out loud, make sure it doesn't relate to the assassin.</p>\n\n<h4>Number of Guesses</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/board.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The field operatives must always make at least one guess. Any wrong guess ends the turn immediately, but if the field operatives guess a word of their team's color, they can keep guessing.</p>\n\n<p>You can stop guessing at any time, but usually you want to guess as many words as the spymaster said. Sometimes you might even want to guess one more:</p>\n\n<p>Example: Red Team's first clue was tree: 2. The red operative wanted to guess ORANGE and NUT.</p>\n\n<p>She guessed ORANGE first. That was an innocent bystander, so she did not get a chance to guess NUT.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Team took a turn and correctly guessed two words. Now it is Red Team's turn again.</p>\n\n<p>The red spymaster says river: 3. The red operative is pretty sure the AMAZON is a river, so she touches that card. The spymaster covers it with a red agent card, so she gets to go again. A river has a BED, so she touches that codename. It's also red, so she can go again.</p>\n\n<p>She's not sure of the third river word. She picks NUT. This has nothing to do with river. She is guessing a word from the previous clue.</p>\n\n<p>NUT is a red word. The operative has made 3 correct guesses for the clue river: 3. She is allowed one final guess. She can try to find the third river word, or she can try to find the other tree word. Or she can stop at three and let Blue Team have a turn.</p>\n\n<p>You are allowed only one extra guess. In the example above, the red operative would be allowed 4 guesses because her spymaster said the number 3. When the field operatives say they are done guessing (or when they guess wrong) it is the other team's turn.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game flow</h2>\n\n<p>Spymasters take turns giving clues. Each turn covers up at least one word, which makes guessing progressively easier.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/spymaster.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The game ends when one team has all their words covered. That team wins.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to win on the other team's turn if they guess your last word.</p>\n\n<p>The game can end early if a field operative makes contact with the assassin. That operative's team loses.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Setup for the Next Game</h3>\n\n<p>Do other people want a chance to be spymasters? Setup for the second game is easy. Remove the cards covering the codenames and put them back in their stacks.</p>\n\n<p>Now just flip over the 25 codenames, and you're ready to go!</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>What's the timer for?</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/codenames/box.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Sorry. We almost forgot. You see, we don't use the sand timer very often.</p>\n\n<p>If a player is thinking too long, any player can flip the sand timer and ask the slow player to make a decision before time runs out.</p>\n\n<p>If you are having trouble, you can even use the sand timer on yourself. If you can't find a good clue before time runs out, just give a clue for your hardest word and keep thinking while the other team plays.</p>\n\n<p>If you prefer to play with strict time limits, you can download our timer app at codenamesgame.com.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"valid-clues.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

He looks at the 6 images in his hand. From one of these, he makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).</p>\n\n<p>The sentence can take different forms: it can be made of one word or more, it can even be a sound. The sentence can be either invented or be inspired from an existing work of art (poetry or song sample, movie title, proverb, etc).</p>\n\n<p>Who is the storyteller for the first turn?

Each player secretly votes for the card that he believes belongs to the storyteller (who doesn't vote).</p> <p>To do so, he places face down in front of him the voting token corresponding to the image he voted for. Once everybody has voted, all the voting tokens are revealed and placed on their corresponding images.</p>\n\n<p>Note: You're not allowed to vote for your own image.</p>\n\n<h3>End of turn</h3>\n\n<p>Each player draws cards into his hand until he has 6.

The player who's the furthest on the scoring track is the winner.</p>\n\n<p>Each player then counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).</p>\n\n<p>A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"tips.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

After that, their team- mates have to guess where the target is.</p>\n\n<p>Your team's goal:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Turn the red dial as close to the center of the colored target as you can.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the twist:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game1.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The target is completely hidden behind this blue screen and is in a random location each round.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, one of your teammates is psychic and knows exactly where the target is!</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>They draw a card that has two opposing concepts on it, like \"Underrated - Overrated\" or \"Hot - Cold\".</p>\n\n<p>The psychic gives a clue where the target is located on the spectrum between the two concepts.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game3.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>In this example, the target is slightly to the \"hot\" side, so the Psychic says \"Coffee\" since coffee is hot, but not the hottest thing imaginable.</p>\n\n<p>Now it's up to the psychic's team to discuss the clue and decide where to turn the dial.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game4.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Everyone thinks out loud and ponders very dumb ideas-all while the other team poisons your brain with bad suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the psychic opens the screen to reveal whether the dial is in the target area.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game5.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The closer to the center of the target, the more points your team scores! (The other team also gets a chance to score).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game6.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Wavelength takes less than a minute to set up and is played entirely in the box: you can just pass the game around without ever taking anything out. To start, place the device (the big plastic thing with the dial and rotating wheel) into the slot in the middle of the box's tray.</p>\n\n<p>Then insert the 3 tokens-the \"heads\" and guessing piece-into their various slots. The diagram on the left shows where everything goes.</p>\n\n<p>Now divide into 2 teams of roughly the same size. Then decide who on those teams will be the Psychics (clue givers) for the first round.</p>\n\n<p>The team that goes first starts at O points. The team that goes second starts at 1 point. We call the teams Left Brain and Right Brain, but you can call yourselves anything you like.</p>\n\n<p>That's it! You're ready to play Wavelength.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>How the game progresses:</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li><b>Psychic Phase:</b> Current team's Psychic gives clue.</li>\n<li><b>Team Phase:</b> Psych ic's team discusses and turns dial.</li>\n<li><b>Left/right Phase:</b> Other team guesses left/right.</li>\n<li><b>Scoring Phase:</b> Psychic reveals target and points are given.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>After Scoring, the other team begins their round UNLESS the catch up rule is triggered, detailed in the next section.</p>\n\n<p>Play continues like this, with teams take turns giving clues, with a new player being the Psychic each time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"box silver2_bg box_radius\">\n\n<h4>An important catch up rule</h4>\n\n<p>No matter how much a team is losing in Wavelength, there's always a chance to catch up. If the Psychic's team scores 4 points, and is still losing to the other team after that round's scoring, they immediately take another turn (with a different player as Psychic).</p>\n\n<p>This means that a team down 9-0 could hypothetically take 3 turns in a row and win.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>A. Psychic Phase</h2>\n\n<p>Each round begins with the current team's Psychic spinning the wheel to randomize the target's location, drawing a wavelength card, and giving a clue ON THE SPECTRUM between the two concepts on the card.</p>\n\n<p>The Psychic should do all of this secretly, so players on both teams can't see where the target is.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the official order the Psychic should go in (it's a little over-detailed, but in practice it's easy):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Close the screen:</b> Rotate the screen using the plastic handle until it's entirely closed and clicks into place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Choose a wavelength:</b> Draw 1 wavelength card from the deck. They're double sided, and the Psychic can choose the side they want to use for their clue. On most cards there's a \"normal\" side and a \"weird\" side. Don't think too hard about it: just pick the one you find most interesting!</p>\n\n<p>Place the card in the slot in front of the device, with your chosen side facing forward, and read the card text so both teams can hear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Randomize the target location:</b> Turn the wheel-using your fingers along the wavy edges-until you're sure that the target is in a completely random position. The plastic screen should be CLOSED while you spin: you can't keep it open to select the target's location.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Open the screen:</b> Using the plastic handle, open the screen and look at where the target is located. You should always open the screen COMPLETELY, even if you can see the target with it partially open: otherwise, players watching you will be able to guess the general target location.</p>\n\n<p>Very infrequently, the target's center (the 4 point wedge) won't be visible at all. If that happens, close the screen and spin again. If the center target is ever partially in view on the left or right extreme, that's valid-even if it's just a sliver.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Give a clue:</b> Look at where the target's center is located spatially along the visible area of the wheel. Now think of a clue that is conceptually where the target is located ON THE SPECTRUM between the two concepts on your card. Rules for how to give clues can be found later in this book.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Close the screen:</b> Using the plastic handle, close the screen completely. Now turn the box to face your team, so they can interact with the device.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>Now the psychic stops communicating entirely!</p>\n\n<p>After the Psychic has given their clue, they are no longer allowed to say ANYTHING-not even clarifications-and must keep an entirely straight face.</p>\n\n<p>If a Psychic ever gives away the target location after giving their clue, either verbally or nonverbally, it's up to everyone playing to decide whether to penalize the team.</p>\n\n<p>We tend to just let the Psychic give a new clue with a new card and target location, but we're generous that way.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>B. Team Phase</h2>\n\n<p>After the Psychic gives their clue, it's up to the rest of their team to READING THEIR MIND and turn the dial as close to the center of the target area as they can.</p>\n\n<p>This is the core of the game and it is almost entirely free of rules: teammates can discuss, debate, and argue in any way they like.</p>\n\n<p>After the Psychic's team has come to an agreement, they let the other team know that they've finalized their dial position.</p>\n\n<p>During this phase, just keep a couple things in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>Don't use percentages or numbers as shorthand for where to turn the dial.</p>\n\n<p>Since Wavelength is based off of gut feelings, you should restrict yourselves to saying things like \"way more to the right\", or \"down a little\" rather than \"turn it to 25%\".</p>\n\n<p>There's no penalty associated with doing this-you should just avoid it in the spirit of the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Everyone on the team has the right to turn the dial at any time. It's up to the team to determine how to negotiate this.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>C. Left/right Phase</h2>\n\n<p>In Wavelength, BOTH teams always have a chance to score points from a clue.</p>\n\n<p>After the Psychic's team has finalized their dial position, the other team gets to guess whether the center of the target (the 4 point wedge) is to the left or right of the dial. This discussion should be fairly brief, since it's a simple binary choice: LEFT or RIGHT.</p>\n\n<p>The team makes their guess by placing the marker in either the LEFT or RIGHT slot next to the wavelength card.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<p>For example, the image below shows the team guessing LEFT, i.e. they think the Psychic meant to convey something MORE HOT than the current team guessed.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game7.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>D. Scoring Phase</h2>\n\n<p>Once both teams have finalized their guesses, it's time for the most exciting part of the game: THE REVEAL. The Psychic opens the screen to reveal the target. Their team scores points if the dial is within the colored target area, as listed on the colored wedges (2-4 points).</p>\n\n<p>If the dial is ever on an edge between two results, the Psychic's team always scores the better of the two results.</p>\n\n<p>The other team scores 1 point if they correctly guessed whether the target is to the left or right of the final dial position. If the Psychic's team guessed perfectly (the 4 point wedge), the other team cannot score.</p>\n\n<p>Move each team's scoring marker by those amounts.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"box box_radius box_border\">\n\n<h4>Psychic Team</h4>\n\n<p>Scores the number of points printed on the wedge that the dial is in. Below, the team scores 3 points.</p>\n\n<h4>Other Team</h4>\n\n<p>Scores by guessing if the center of the target is to the left or right of the dial.</p>\n\n<p>Below, if the team had guessed LEFT, they would score 1 point.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/wavelength/game8.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>Once a team has reached 10 points, the game ends and the t<b>eam with the highest score wins</b>!</p>\n\n<p>If there's a tie, each team takes a final sudden death turn. The team that scores the most points that round wins (including the LEFT/RIGHT guess). If there's still a tie, repeat until a team has won.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"box tucked_corner\">\n\n<h3>Cooperative Mode</h3>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>In this mode, everyone wins or loses together as a single team. It works really well with 2-5 players, but you can play at any size. The rules are mostly the same, except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>To start, put 7 random wavelength cards in the card slot. When that deck runs out, the game is over. Then use the chart on the right to determine how well you did!</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Points works the same as usual, except the center wedge is only worth 3 points-but you ALSO get to draw a bonus card to add to the deck, adding an extra round to the game.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Skip the left/right guessing phase.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<table class=\"table table-condensed table-striped border\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Score</th><th>How you did</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>0-3</td><td>Are you sure it's plugged in?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4-6</td><td>Try turning it off and back on again</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7-9</td><td>Blow into the bottom of the device</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10 - 12</td><td>Not bad!

You all play together to get the best score!</p>\n\n<p>Together, make one of the players - the active player - guess a Mystery word by secretly writing a clue on your easel.</p>\n\n<p>Choose your clue without coordinating with each other and be original so as not to write the same clue as ano- ther player, as all identical clues will be canceled before the active player gets to see them.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, tally your score based on the number of Mystery words found.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Shuffle the cards and randomly draw 13 to create a face-down deck in the middle of the table. Return the remaining cards to the box, they will not be used this game.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Give an easel and an erasable felt marker to each player.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Randomly choose a player to be the first active player.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game1.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The game plays out in a succession of turns and ends when the deck of cards is empty.</p>\n\n<p>Each turn is divided into 4 phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>choose the mystery word</li>\n<li>Clue selection</li>\n<li>Comparing clues</li>\n<li>Guess</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game4.jpg\"> Choose The Mystery Word</h2>\n\n<p>The active player draws the top card of the deck without looking at it, and places it on their easel so that all of the other players can see the words (one of the sides of the easel has a support to hold the card).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game13.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The player then chooses a number between 1 and 5 to tell the other players which Mystery word they have to provide a clue for.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> If players don't know the chosen word, they can ask the active player to choose a different number.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game5.jpg\"> Clue Selection</h2>\n\n<p>Without communicating with each other and without showing it to anyone each player writes one clue on their easel. That clue must be composed of a single word.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> a digit, a number, an acronym, an onomatopoeia, or a special character are all considered to be words.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> 007 is allowed to help someone guess Bond, just like Riiiiiinnng or SMS are allowed to help someone guess Telephone, and $ is allowed to help someone guess America.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game9.jpg\"> Invalid Clues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>The Mystery word but <b>written differently</b>.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Shurt is not allowed when trying to make the player guess Shirt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>The Mystery word written in a <b>foreign language</b>.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Buisson is not allowed if the word to be guessed is Shrub.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>A word from the <b>same family</b> as the Mystery word.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Princess is not allowed if the word to be guessed is Prince.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>An <b>invented word</b>.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Swee'ting is not allowed to try to help someone guess Cake.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>A word <b>phonetically identical</b> to the Mystery word, but the meaning of which is different.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Whether is not allowed to try to get someone to guess Weather.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game6.jpg\"> Comparing Clues</h2>\n\n<p>Once all players have written their clues, the active player closes their eyes.</p>\n\n<p>During this time, the other players turn their easels around and compare their clue with the other players. All identical or invalid clues are cancelled. To cancel a clue, simply tip the easel over to hide the clue.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game10.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game11.jpg\"> Identical Clues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>Two identical words.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Mouse and Mouse are identical.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Variants from the same word family.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Prince and Princess are considered to be identical.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Variants of the same word: plurals, gender differentiations, and spelling mistakes don't count as actual differences. Example: Prince and Princes, Actor and Actress, Philosophy and Filosofie are identical.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> If all clues have been cancelled, place the Mystery word's card back in the box and move directly to the End of turn phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game7.jpg\"> Guess</h2>\n\n<p>Once the identical or invalid clues have been cancelled, ask the active player to open their eyes and try to guess the Mystery word with the help of the remaining clues. To do this, they're allowed <b>ONLY ONE GUESS</b>.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Results</h3>\n\n<h4><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game15.jpg\"> Success</h4>\n\n<p>If the active player correctly guesses the Mystery word: place this card face up next to the deck.</p>\n\n<h4><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game16.jpg\"> Failure</h4>\n\n<p>If the active player makes a wrong guess : return this card AND the top card of the deck to the game box.</p>\n\n<h4><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/just-one/game17.jpg\"> Skip</h4>\n\n<p>If the active player chooses not to answer and skips their turn : return this card to the game box.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Notes:</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the active player's guess has the same pronunciation as the Mystery word, that guess is considered to be valid.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the player gives a wrong guess during the final turn, also remove a card previously guessed successfully.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Turn</h2>\n\n<p>The player to the left of the active player becomes the new active player. A new turn begins.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> make sure to properly erase your old clue between turns.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends when the deck is empty.</p>\n\n<p>Count the number of successfully guessed cards and compare your total with this table to get your score:</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-condensed table-striped border\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Successful Cards</th><th>Score</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>13</td><td>Perfect score!

Can you do better?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4-6</td><td>That's a good start.

Then he takes the 5 Camels from their tents and places each onto a specific space of the Race track: Each Camel whose matching Die has a facing up, he must place onto space 1 (the space with flag 1).</p> <p>Each Camel whose matching Die has a facing up, he must place onto space 2. Each Camel whose matching Die has a facing up, he must place onto space 3. Finally he stacks up all Camels which stand together on the same space.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>The movement of the Camels</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/movementofcamels.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>The Camels move clockwise around the Race track. During the game, the players move the Camels using the Pyramid.</p>\n\n<p>When a player turns the Pyramid upside down and pushes the slider, he reveals 1 colored Die. Then he must move the Camel of the revealed color as many spaces forward as the Die shows.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/camelstack.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Camel stack</h4>\n\n<p>Camels on the same space always form a Camel stack. If a Camel is moved that is part of a Camel stack, it carries along all Camels that sit on top of it. Any Camels beneath it are left where they are.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/camelunit.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Camel unit</h4>\n\n<p>Since sometimes single Camels and sometimes Camel stacks are moved, we use the term Camel unit. A Camel unit consists either of a single Camel or a stack of Camels.</p>\n\n<p>If a Camel unit ends its movement on a space where there is another Camel unit, it jumps on top of that other unit.</p>\n\n<p>Important: For all purposes of ranking, a Camel that sits on top of another Camel is always considered ahead of the Camel it sits on.</p>\n\n<h3>The Legs</h3>\n\n<p>The race comprises several Legs. A Leg ends when the last of the 5 Dice has come out of the Pyramid and the respective Camel has moved. Right at the end of each Leg, a Leg scoring round occurs, in which players receive or lose money according to the tiles they have acquired during the Leg.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, a new Leg starts by returning the acquired tiles to the game board and the 5 Dice to the Pyramid.</p>\n\n<h3>Money</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/poundcoinscards.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>The currency in this game is Egyptian Pounds (from now on also referred to as EP). You must store your money publicly in front of you. However, you may stack it up in any way you want.</p>\n\n<p>For the duration of the race, no player is obliged to disclose his exact amount of money.</p>\n\n<p>At any time during the game, you may exchange money one-to-one with money from the bank (for example, exchanging five 1 Pound coins for one 5 Pound coin and so on).</p>\n\n<p>No player can drop below 0 EP. This means when you do not have the money to pay a lost bet, you are spared from doing so.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The player with the Leg Starting Player marker begins the first Leg (and thus the game) by performing exactly 1 action.</p>\n\n<p>Then the player to his left performs 1 action, then the next player and so on. Therefore, play proceeds continuously in a clockwise direction. There are 4 possible actions.</p>\n\n<p>When it is your turn, you must choose and perform exactly 1 of them:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>Take the top Leg Betting tile of any stack (and thus back the Camel of that color to win the current Leg).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Place your Desert tile onto the Race track.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Take 1 Pyramid tile and then move 1 Camel via the Pyramid.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Bet on the overall winner OR overall loser by placing 1 of your Race Betting cards face down onto the appropriate Betting space.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The game ends as soon as the first Camel crosses the finish line. Then a final Leg scoring round occurs, as well as an End scoring round for the overall winning Camel and the overall losing Camel.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/legbettingtile.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>I. Take 1 Leg Betting tile</h3>\n\n<p>Take the top Leg Betting tile from any stack on the Game board and place it in front of you. By doing this, you back the Camel of that color (which means that you hope it will be in the lead at the end of the Leg).</p>\n\n<p>There is no limit to the number of Leg Betting tiles you may collect throughout the Leg. You may even have several of the same color lying in front of you.</p>\n\n<h3>II. Place your Desert tile</h3>\n\n<p>Place your Desert tile onto an empty space of the Race track (that has no Camels or Desert tile on it). However, you are not allowed to place it onto a space that is adjacent to a space that already contains a Desert tile. Also, you may never place your Desert tile onto space 1 of the Race track.</p>\n\n<p>If your Desert tile is already on the Game board, you may use this action to move it to a different space (following the same rules).</p>\n\n<p>When you place (or move) your Desert tile, you can either place it with its Oasis side up or with its Mirage side up. Depending on the side, the Desert tile will influence the movement of Camels that stop on the tile in different ways.</p>\n\n<h3>III. Take 1 Pyramid tile</h3>\n\n<p>Take the top Pyramid tile from the stack on the Game board and place it in front of you.</p>\n\n<p>Then immediately take the Pyramid, shake it thoroughly, and reveal one Die from it.</p>\n\n<p>How to use the Pyramid:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/howusepyramid.jpg\" class=\"margin-bottom-10\">\n\n<p>Note: If no Die appears, turn the Pyramid back up and shake it once more before trying the steps above again.</p>\n\n<p>After you have revealed the Die, move the Camel of its color as many spaces forward as shown on the Die: 1, 2, or 3 spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: If you move a Camel that is part of a Camel stack, it carries along all Camels that sit on top of it (and forms a Camel unit with them).</p>\n\n<p>Example: The orange Die is revealed and shows a 3. The orange Camel moves 3 spaces forward carrying along the yellow Camel.</p>\n\n<p>If a Camel unit ends its movement on a space where there is another Camel unit, it jumps on top of that other unit.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/example4.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Example: The white Die is revealed and shows a 2. The white Camel moves 2 spaces forward, carrying along the green Camel. Since the yellow Camel is already on the space on which they end their movement, white and green jump on top of it as a unit.</p>\n\n<h4>Desert tiles</h4>\n\n<p>If a Camel unit ends its movement on a space that is occupied by a Desert tile, the owner of that tile immediately receives 1 Egyptian Pound from the bank. Also (depending on which side of the tile is facing up) the Camel unit must immediately move 1 additional space forward or 1 space backward:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/oasis.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>If the tile has its Oasis side facing up, the Camel unit moves 1 space forward. If it thereby lands on a space where there is another Camel unit, it jumps on top of that unit as usual.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/mirage.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>If the tile has its Mirage side facing up, the Camel unit moves 1 space backward. If it thereby lands on a space where there is another Camel unit, however, it is placed underneath that unit.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>In both cases, the Desert tile remains on its space (at least until the next Leg scoring round).</p>\n\n<p>After you have moved the appropriate Camel, place the revealed Die onto the tent of its color. This way, everybody can keep track of which Dice are already out of the Pyramid.</p>\n\n<p>Keep the acquired Pyramid tile lying in front of you. In the next Leg scoring round, you will receive 1 Egyptian Pound for each Pyramid tile you have acquired during the Leg.</p>\n\n<h3>IV. Bet on the overall winner or overall loser</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/winner.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>As your action, you can bet on the overall winner. This means, you secretly back the Camel that you believe will be in the lead at the end of the game. To do this, secretly choose 1 of your Race betting cards (in the color of the Camel you think will win) and put it face down onto the Betting space for the overall winner.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/loser.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>You may instead bet on the overall loser (backing the Camel that you believe will be last on the Race track at the end of the game) by secretly choosing 1 of your Race Betting cards and putting it face down onto the Betting space for the overall loser.</p>\n\n<p>If there are already any cards on your chosen Betting space, you simply put yours on top of those cards.</p>\n\n<p>Once placed, a card must stay where it is, even if you later realize you backed the wrong Camel. However, as long as you have cards in hand, you may always choose as your action to place 1 of them onto either Betting space.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of a Leg</h2>\n\n<p>When a player takes the last Pyramid tile from the Game board, he first reveals the last Die from the Pyramid and moves the respective Camel as usual. Then, before the next player takes his turn, a Leg scoring round occurs for all players:</p>\n\n<p>Start by giving the Leg Starting Player marker to the player that sits to the left of the player who just took the last Pyramid tile (so you will remember who will start the next Leg).</p>\n\n<p>Then see which Camel is in the lead (on the space farthest along the Race track). If there is a stack of Camels in the lead, the leading Camel is the one on top of the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Now, each player gains or loses Egyptian Pounds according to the Pyramid and Leg Betting tiles lying in front of him.</p>\n\n<p>Each player adds up his total amount and then takes it from (or pays it to) the bank accordingly.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/leg1.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>For each Leg Betting tile of the leading Camel, the player gains the number of Egyptian Pounds printed in large on the tile: 5, 3, or 2.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/leg2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>For each Leg Betting tile of the Camel in second place, the player gains 1 EP.</p>\n\n<p>For each Leg Betting tile of any other Camel, the player loses 1 EP.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/leg3.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>For each Pyramid tile, the player gains 1 EP.</p>\n\n<p>Example: In the Leg scoring round, the green Camel is in the lead. The yellow Camel is in second place. Martina has the following tiles in front of her, which give her 9 Egyptian Pounds in total:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/9pounds.jpg\" class=\"margin-bottom-10\">\n\n<p>After all players have collected (or paid) their money, return all Leg Betting tiles and all Pyramid tiles to the appropriate spaces on the Game board (in the same way as in the setup). Also, remove any Desert tiles from the Game board and return them to their owners.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, return the 5 Dice from the tents to the Pyramid. Then the player with the Leg Starting Player marker starts the new Leg.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/end.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>As soon as the first Camel unit crosses the finish line, the race ends immediately. Now, carry out the Leg scoring round one last time (as described on the left).</p>\n\n<p>After this final Leg scoring round, the End scoring round for the overall winner and overall loser occurs. For this, first attend to the face-down card deck on the Betting space for the overall winner. Remember: the card on the bottom was the first card placed, the card on top the last. Turn the entire deck face up, so that now the card placed first is face up on top while the card placed last is on the bottom. Now players gain or lose money according to the cards they have placed. Start at the top and go through the face-up deck card by card.</p>\n\n<p>Only cards that show the actual winning Camel grant money:</p>\n\n<p>The player (if any) that placed the first card showing the actual winner of the race receives 8 Egyptian Pound from the bank. </p>\n\n<p>The player (if any) who placed the second card showing the winner receives 5 EP, the third player 3 EP, the fourth player 2 EP, all others 1 EP.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: this only applies to cards showing the actual winner. For each card in the deck that shows any Camel other than the winner, the owner of that card must pay 1 EP to the bank.</p>\n\n<p>After going through the deck for the overall winner, go through the deck of cards for the overall loser in the same way. The overall loser, of course, is the least advanced Camel (in the case of a stack, it is the Camel on the bottom of the stack).</p>\n\n<p>Example: The green Camel is the winner of the race, the white Camel the loser. The decks on the Betting spaces give the respective owners of the cards EP as follows:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/camel-up/endexample.jpg\" class=\"margin-bottom-10\">\n\n<p>After the End scoring round, all players count their money. The player who collected the most Egyptian Pounds wins the game. In the case of a tie, the victory is shared.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"buy-camel-up.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Remove the top card of the deck from the game without looking at it.</p>\n\n<p>If you are playing a two-player game, take three more cards from the top of the deck and place them to the side, face up. They will not be used during this round.</p>\n\n<p>Each player draws one card from the deck. This is the player's hand, and is kept secret from the others.</p>\n\n<p>Whoever was most recently on a date goes first (if tied, the younger player wins the tie).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/love-letter/zegel.png\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>In the wake of the arrest of Queen Marianna for high treason, none was more heartbroken than her daughter, Princess Annette. Suitors throughout the City-State of Tempest sought to ease Annette's sorrow by courting her to bring some joy into her life.</p>\n\n<p>You are one of these suitors, trying to get your love letter to the princess. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, so you must rely on intermediaries to carry your message.</p>\n\n<p>During the game, you hold one secret card in your hand. This is who currently carries your message of love for the princess.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure that the person closest to the princess holds your love letter at the end of the day, so it reaches her first!</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/love-letter/love.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Love Letter is played in a series of rounds. Each round represents one day. At the end of each round, one player's letter reaches Princess Annette, and she reads it.</p>\n\n<p>When she reads enough letters from one suitor, she becomes enamored and grants that suitor permission to court her. That player wins the princess's heart and the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Taking a Turn</h3>\n\n<p>On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then choose one of the two cards in your hand and discard it face up in front of you. Apply any effect on the card you discarded. You must apply its effect, even if it is bad for you.</p>\n\n<p>All discarded cards remain in front of the player who discarded them. Overlap the cards so that it's clear in which order they were discarded. This helps players to figure out which cards other players might be holding.</p>\n\n<p>Once you finish applying the card's effect, the turn passes to the player on your left.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Out of the Round</h3>\n\n<p>If a player is knocked out of the round, that player discards the card in his or her hand face up (do not apply the card's effect) and takes no more turns until next round.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Honesty</h3>\n\n<p>A player could cheat when chosen with the Guard, or fail to discard the Countess when that player has the King or Prince in hand. We suggest that you don't play with knaves who cheat at fun, light games.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/love-letter/cards.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>End of a Round</h3>\n\n<p>A round ends if the deck is empty at the end of a turn. The royal residence closes for the evening, the person closest to the princess delivers the love letter, and Princess Annette retires to her chambers to read it.</p>\n\n<p>All players still in the round reveal their hands. The player with the highest ranked person wins the round. In case of a tie, the player who discarded the highest total value of cards wins.</p>\n\n<p>A round also ends if all players but one are out of the round, in which case the remaining player wins.</p>\n\n<p>The winner receives a token of affection. Shuffle all 16 cards together, and play a new round following all of the setup rules.</p>\n\n<p>The winner of the previous round goes first, because the princess speaks kindly of him or her at breakfast.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/love-letter/box.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<p>A player wins the game after winning a number of tokens based on the number of players:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 Players: 7 tokens</li>\n<li>3 Players: 5 tokens</li>\n<li>4 players: 4 tokens</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"the-people.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Keep your hand secret.</p>\n\n<p>Insert enough Exploding Kittens back into the deck so that there is 1 fewer than the number of people playing. Remove any extra Exploding Kittens from the game.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/setup2.png\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Insert the extra Defuse cards back in the deck.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the deck, and put it face down in the middle of the table. This is your Draw Pile</p>\n\n<p>Pick a player to go first. (Some sample criteria: most impressive beard, most intimidating odor, shortest spleen, etc).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>If you explode, you lose. if you don't explode, YOU WIN and all of the other cards</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>You'll have a deck of cards containing some Exploding Kittens. You play the game by putting the deck face down and taking turns drawing cards off the top until someone draws an Exploding Kitten.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/how-it-works.png\"><br>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>Play a card from your hand by placing it face up on top of the Discard Pile, and following the instructions on the card. Or play no cards at all; that's cool too.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>After you follow the instructions on a card or play a Pair, you can play more cards. You can play as many cards as you'd like.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Finally, end your turn by drawing a card from the top of the Draw Pile into your hand and hoping it's not an Exploding Kitten.</p>\n\n<p>(This is different from most other games in that you end your turn by drawing a card).</p>\n\n<p>Play continues clockwise around the table.</p>\n\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Notes:</h4>\n\n<p>You can count the cards left in the Draw Pile. You won't ever run out of cards in the Draw Pile, so there's never a need to reshuffle.</p>\n\n<p>There is no maximum or minimum hand size. If you run out of cards in your hand, there's no special action to take. Keep playing. You'll draw at least 1 more card on your next turn.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/cards.png\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Cards</h2>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/defuse.png\"> Defuse (6 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>If you drew an Exploding Kitten, you can play this card instead of dying. Place your Defuse card in the Discard Pile.</p>\n\n<p>Then take the Exploding Kitten, and without reordering or viewing the other cards, secretly put it back in the Draw Pile anywhere you'd like.</p>\n\n<p>Want to screw over the player right after you? Put the Kitten right on top of the deck. If you'd like, hold the deck under the table so that no one else can see where you put it. Now the next player goes (unless you must take multiple turns).</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/nope.png\"> Nope (5 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>Stop any action except for an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse card. Imagine that any card (or Pair or Special Combo) beneath a Nope card no longer exists.</p>\n\n<p>You can also play a Nope on another Nope to negate it and create a Yup, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>You can play a Nope card at any time before an action has begun, even if it's not your turn.</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/exploding.png\"> Exploding Kitten (4 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>You must show this card immediately. Unless you have a Defuse card, you're dead. Discard all of your cards, including the Exploding Kitten.</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/attack.png\"> Attack (4 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>End your turn(s) without drawing and force the next player to take 2 turns in a row. The victim of this card takes a turn as normal (play cards, then draw). Then, when their first turn is over, it's their turn again. (If the victim of an Attack card plays an Attack card, their turns are immediately over, and the next player must take 2 turns).</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/skip.png\"> Skip (4 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>Immediately end your turn without drawing a card. (If you play a Skip card as a defense to an Attack card, it only ends 1 of the 2 turns. 2 Skip cards would end both turns).</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/favor.png\"> Favor (4 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>Force any other player to give you 1 card from their hand. They choose which card to give you.</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/shuffle.png\"> Shuffle (4 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>Shuffle the Draw Pile thoroughly and randomly without viewing the cards. (Useful when you know there's an Exploding Kitten coming).</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/future.png\"> See the future (5 cards)</h3>\n\n<p>Peek at the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile and put them back in the same order. Don't show the cards to the other players.</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/cats.png\"> Cat Cards (4 of each type)</h3>\n\n<p>Some cards don't have any instructions on them. These cards are powerless on their own, but can be played in Pairs or Special Combos.</p>\n\n<p>If you play matching pairs with no instructions on them, pick another player and steal a random card from their hand.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Example Turn</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/exploding-kittens/example.png\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You decide to play a see the future card.</p>\n\n<p>While viewing the 3 top cards, you see that the card you're about to draw is an Exploding Kitten.</p>\n\n<p>You decide to play an attack card to end your turn and force the next player to take 2 turns.</p>\n\n<p>but then another player plays a Nope card which cancels your attack, so it's still your turn.</p>\n\n<p>You don't want to draw that top card and die, so you play a Shuffle card and randomly shuffle the Draw Pile.</p>\n\n<p>With the deck freshly shuffled, you draw the top card to end your turn and hope it's not an exploding kitten.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"special-combos.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

The first player to accumulate 10 victory points claims the Imperial Throne and wins the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/components.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n<ul>\n<li>17 Faction Sheets</li>\n<li>6 Command Sheets</li>\n<li>51 System Tiles</li>\n<li>354 Plastic Units</li>\n<li>8 Strategy Cards</li>\n<li>8 Ten-Sided Dice</li>\n<li>1 Victory Point Track</li>\n<li>59 Planet Cards</li>\n<li>40 Objective Cards</li>\n<li>80 Action Cards</li>\n<li>50 Agenda Cards</li>\n<li>41 Promissory Note Cards</li>\n<li>1 Speaker Token</li>\n<li>122 Technology Cards</li>\n<li>1 Custodians Token</li>\n<li>62 Unit Upgrade Technology Cards</li>\n<li>2 Creuss Alpha/Beta Wormhole Tokens</li>\n<li>1 Naalu \"0\" Token</li>\n<li>2 Nekro X/Y Assimilator Tokens</li>\n<li>48 Trade Good and Commodity Tokens</li>\n<li>272 Command Tokens</li>\n<li>289 Control Tokens</li>\n<li>49 Infantry Tokens</li>\n<li>49 Fighter Tokens</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Units</h3>\n\n<p>During a game of Twilight Imperium, each player's units are represented by plastic figures. There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures.</p>\n\n<h4>Ships</h4>\n\n<p>Ships represent spacefaring units. Players use these units to engage one another in space combat and expand their empires to new systems.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game20.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Ground Forces</h4>\n\n<p>Ground forces represent foot soldiers. Players use these units to invade planets or defend their own territories.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game20_.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Structures</h4>\n\n<p>Structures represent military installations built by an empire to support its war effort.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game21.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Reinforcements</h4>\n\n<p>A player's personal supply of unused units and unused command tokens is his reinforcements. When producing units and gaining command tokens during the game, players will take those components from their reinforcements.</p>\n\n<h3>Systems And Planets</h3>\n\n<p>The game board for Twilight Imperium is formed using modular system tiles. Each tile represents a single system in the galaxy, which may contain one or more planets or other celestial bodies.</p>\n\n<h5>Placing Units On System Tiles</h5>\n\n<p>When a unit is placed in a system, it is placed in one of two areas on the tile. Structures and ground forces are usually placed on planets, while ships are placed in space-the star-filled area surrounding the planets.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game18.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Planets</h4>\n\n<p>As players move about the galaxy and expand their empire beyond their home systems, they will gain control of new planets.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game17.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When a player gains control of a planet, he takes that planet's card from either the deck of planet cards or from the player who controlled it previously and places it facedown in his play area.</p>\n\n<p>Each planet card displays two values: resources on the left in yellow and influence on the right in blue. Players spend resources to acquire new units and technologies. Players spend influence to gain command tokens and to vote during the agenda phase.</p>\n\n<p>If a player ever controls a planet, but has no units on that planet, he places one of the control tokens that matches his faction on that planet to mark that he controls it.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game22.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>First-Game Setup</h2>\n\n<p>When playing for the first time, players perform the following steps to set up the game. Some components are not used during the first game, and are explained in detail at the end of this booklet.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game23.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h5>1. Determine Speaker:</h5>\n\n<p>Randomly determine one player to take the speaker token. This player is the speaker and will go first when the game begins.</p>\n\n<h5>2. Assign Factions:</h5>\n\n<p>Each player controls a faction with unique strengths and weaknesses. Each faction has a sheet which shows the attributes and abilities of that faction's units as well as abilities unique to the faction itself. Gather the following faction sheets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/f1.jpg\"> The Xxcha Kingdom</li>\n<li><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/f2.jpg\"> The Federation of Sol</li>\n<li><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/f3.jpg\"> The Emirates of Hacan</li>\n<li><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/f4.jpg\"> The Barony of Letnev</li>\n<li><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/f5.jpg\"> The Sardakk N'orr</li>\n<li><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/f6.jpg\"> The Universities of Jol-Nar</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The speaker deals one random faction sheet from the list above to each player.</p>\n\n<h5>3. Gather Faction-specific Components:</h5>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game25.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Each player takes the following components that match his faction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 home system tile</li>\n<li>17 control tokens</li>\n<li>16 command tokens</li>\n<li>2 technology cards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each player's faction-specific components contain a faction symbol that matches the symbol on his faction sheet. Each player places his faction sheet and all of his faction's components in front of him. Return all unused faction components to the game box.</p>\n\n<h5>4. Choose Color:</h5>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game25_.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Each player chooses a color and takes the following components that match his chosen color:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>59 plastic units</li>\n<li>1 command sheet</li>\n<li>25 technology cards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each player slides the edge of his command sheet under his faction sheet and places the other components nearby.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game26.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h5>5. Gather Starting Planet Cards:</h5>\n\n<p>Each player takes the planet cards that correspond to the planets in his home system and places them faceup near his faction sheet.</p>\n\n<h5>6. Create Game Board:</h5>\n\n<p>Players create the game board using the diagram that corresponds to the number of players. Experienced players create a custom game board at the start of each game, as explained later.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game31.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h5>7.

Gather Starting Components:</h5>\n\n<p>Each player takes the starting technology and starting units listed on the back of his faction sheet. Each player places the technology cards faceup near his faction sheet and the starting units in his home system. If a player has multiple planets in his home system, it is recommended that he place his space dock and infantry on the planet with the highest resource value.</p>\n\n<p>Each player places three command tokens in his tactic pool, three command tokens in his fleet pool (ship silhouette side up), and two command tokens in his strategy pool. These pools are located on the player's command sheet.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game30.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>12. Prepare Objectives:</h4>\n<ol type=\"I\">\n<li>Each player draws one secret objective and keeps it hidden from other players.</li>\n<li>Place the victory point track near the game board with its 0-10 side faceup. Then, each player places one of his control tokens on space \"0\" of the track.</li>\n<li>The speaker draws five stage I objective cards from the deck and places them facedown in a row above the victory point track. Then, he draws five stage II objective cards from the deck and places them facedown in a row below the victory point track.</li>\n<li>The speaker reveals the first two stage I objectives.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game34.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Twilight Imperium is played over a series of game rounds, each of which contains the following four phases that players must resolve in order.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><b>Strategy Phase:</b> During this phase, each player chooses a strategy card. These cards provide players with powerful abilities to use during the action phase. Each card also has a number that determines turn order for the game round.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Action Phase:</b> During this phase, the majority of the game's action occurs. This includes moving units, producing units, resolving combat, and using strategy cards.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Status Phase:</b> During this phase, players perform cleanup steps in preparation for the next game round.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Agenda Phase:</b> During this phase, players vote on political agendas, which can have lasting ramifications in the game. The agenda phase is added to the game after a player gains control of Mecatol Rex.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These phases repeat in successive game rounds until one player accumulates 10 victory points and wins the game.</p>\n\n<p>These phases are described in detail in the following sections.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>1. Strategy Phase</h2>\n\n<p>During the strategy phase, players take turns selecting a strategy card that provides them with a unique action they can use during the action phase. First-time players may not know which strategy card to choose and should consult the strategy card overviews at the bottom of this page and the next.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with the speaker and continuing clockwise, each player chooses one of the strategy cards from the common play area and places it faceup near his faction sheet. After a player chooses a strategy card, it is not available for other players during this game round.</p>\n\n<p>Each strategy card has a number between \"1\" and \"8\" in the upper-right corner. During the action phase, players take turns in order according to the number printed on their chosen strategy card, starting with \"1\". This is called initiative order.</p>\n\n<p>After each player has chosen a strategy card, the speaker places one trade good on each strategy card that was not chosen. During future strategy phases, when a player chooses a strategy card that has one or more trade goods on it, he gains those trade goods.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h3>Strategy Card Overview</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game37.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>1. <b>Leadership</b>: A player might choose this card to gain more command tokens, enabling him to perform more actions during the action phase.</p>\n\n<p>2. <b>Diplomacy</b>: A player might choose this card if he feels threatened, to prevent other players from attacking his system.</p>\n\n<p>3. <b>Politics</b>: A player might choose this card to draw action cards, increasing the variety of abilities that are available to him.</p>\n\n<p>4. <b>Construction</b>: A player might choose this card to produce planetary structures, such as space docks and PDS units.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>2. Action Phase</h2>\n\n<p>The action phase is the main phase of the game, during which players produce units, move ships, enact strategies, and interact with other players.</p>\n\n<p>During the action phase, players take turns in initiative order. While a player is taking a turn, he is the active player, and he can perform one action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. Initiative order may repeat in this manner several times within a single action phase. The action phase does not end until each player has passed (see below).</p>\n\n<p>There are three types of actions: tactical actions, strategic actions, and component actions. They are described in detail later.</p>\n\n<p>If a player does not wish to perform an action during his turn, he may pass. After a player passes, his turn is skipped for the remainder of the action phase. A player cannot pass until he has performed his strategic action, which is explained later. After each player has passed, the game round continues to the status phase.</p>\n\n<h3>Tactical Action</h3>\n\n<p>A tactical action allows a player to move ships, initiate combat, invade planets, produce units, and otherwise interact with the game board.</p>\n\n<p>To understand a tactical action, players need to understand many other game concepts, such as movement and combat. For this reason, the steps of a tactical action are summarized below, but are not described in detail until later.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><b>Activation:</b> The active player must activate a system by taking a command token from his tactic pool and placing it in that system.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Movement:</b> The active player may move ships into a system from any number of other systems. Ships can also transport ground forces from one system to another.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Space Combat:</b> If multiple players have ships in the active system, they resolve a space combat.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Invasion:</b> The active player may commit ground forces to land on planets in the active system. If another player has units on those planets, the players resolve a ground combat.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Production:</b> If the active player has a space dock in the active system, he can produce units by spending resources.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A player might not resolve all of the above steps during every tactical action. For example, a player may choose not to move units during the \"Movement\" step but may still produce units during the \"Production\" step.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h3>Strategy Card Overview</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game39.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>5. <b>Trade</b>: A player might choose this card to gain trade goods and commodities, which he could use to produce additional units or trade to other players.</p>\n\n<p>6. <b>Warfare</b>: A player might choose this card to allow some of his ships to move twice, or to build a unit and move it during the same game round.</p>\n\n<p>7. <b>Technology</b>: A player might choose this card to research a new technology that would grant him a new ability or unit upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>8. <b>Imperial</b>: A player might choose this card to draw an additional secret objective, granting him additional routes to victory.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Strategic Action</h3>\n\n<p>Each strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability.</p>\n\n<p>When a player performs a strategic action, he resolves the primary ability of his strategy card. After resolving this ability, each other player may resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. The active player cannot resolve the secondary ability of his own strategy card.</p>\n\n<p>After each player has had an opportunity to resolve a strategy card's secondary ability, the active player exhausts that strategy card by flipping it facedown. Players cannot resolve abilities on exhausted strategy cards, but the exhausted cards' numbers are still used to determine initiative order.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game43.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>A player cannot pass during the action phase unless his strategy card is exhausted. This means that each player must perform a strategic action at some point during the action phase, which guarantees that each other player has an opportunity to resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. A player who has passed during the action phase can still resolve the secondary ability of other players' strategy cards.</p>\n\n<h3>Component Actions</h3>\n\n<p>A component action is an action that is printed on a game component. Many action cards, faction sheets, and even some technology cards have component actions. Each of these effects is preceded by the word \"Action\".</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game38.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<h3>Key Concept: Command Sheet</h3>\n\n<p>Successfully navigating the action phase in Twilight Imperium requires careful management of command tokens. When a player gains a command token, he places it in any one of three pools: the tactic pool, the fleet pool, or the strategy pool.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game44.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Tactic Pool</h4>\n\n<p>During the action phase, players may spend command tokens from their tactic pool to perform tactical actions.</p>\n\n<h4>Fleet Pool</h4>\n\n<p>Players place command tokens in their fleet pool with the ship silhouette faceup. Players do not spend these command tokens like the command tokens in their other pools.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the number of tokens in a player's fleet pool is the maximum number of ships, excluding fighters, that he can have in each system.</p>\n\n<p>If a player ever has more ships in a system than he has tokens in his fleet pool, he must return ships from that system to his reinforcements until the number of ships in that system no longer exceeds the number of tokens in his fleet pool.</p>\n\n<h4>Strategy Pool</h4>\n\n<p>Most of the secondary abilities on strategy cards require a player to spend a token from his strategy pool to resolve the ability. Players will want to keep tokens in their strategy pool so that they can use the secondary abilities of the other players' strategy cards.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>3. Status Phase</h2>\n\n<p>During the status phase, players perform various upkeep tasks, including repairing units and scoring objectives. To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps in order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><b>Score objectives:</b> In initiative order, each player may score up to one public and one secret objective if he fulfills those cards' requirements. This is the main way in which players gain the victory points they need to win the game. Objectives are described in detail later.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Reveal public objective:</b> The speaker flips the next unrevealed public objective card faceup. The first stage II objective is not revealed until all stage I objectives have been revealed.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Draw action cards:</b> Each player draws one card from the top of the action card deck.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Remove command tokens:</b> Each player removes all of his command tokens from the game board and returns them to his reinforcements.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Gain and redistribute command tokens:</b> Each player gains two command tokens from his reinforcements. Then, he may redistribute any of the command tokens on his command sheet by moving them between his tactic, fleet, and strategy pools.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Ready cards:</b> Each player readies all of his exhausted cards, including planet, technology, and strategy cards.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Repair units:</b> Some units may have been turned on their side during the action phase to mark that they have been damaged. Players repair these units during this step by turning them upright. This is described in detail later.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Return strategy cards:</b> Each player returns his strategy card to the common play area. Then, if the custodians token is no longer on Mecatol Rex (the planet in the center of the game board) the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.<br><br><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game45.jpg\"></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<h3>Key Concept: Readied And Exhausted Cards</h3>\n\n<p>Many cards have a readied and an exhausted state. An exhausted card is flipped facedown, indicating that the values and abilities on the front of the card cannot be used.</p>\n\n<p>During the status phase, all exhausted cards are readied. A readied card is flipped faceup, indicating that the values and abilities on the front of the card can be used.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game47.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>4. Agenda Phase</h2>\n\n<p>After the custodians token has been removed from Mecatol Rex, a new phase is added to each round for the remainder of the game: the agenda phase.</p>\n\n<p>During this phase, the galactic council convenes to discuss issues that affect the entire galaxy. Players vote for outcomes on two agendas, establishing laws and policies that have lasting repercussions.</p>\n\n<p>Voting on agendas is described in detail later.</p>\n\n<p>After resolving this phase, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>A game of Twilight Imperium immediately ends when one player has gained 10 victory points. Players gain victory points by completing objectives. There are two types of objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Public objectives:</b> During setup, the speaker reveals two public objectives, and more are revealed throughout the game. Any number of players can score each of these objectives.</p>\n\n<p><i>Important:</i> A player cannot score public objectives if he does not control all of the planets in his home system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>Secret objectives:</b> Each player begins the game with one secret objective that he may look at but must keep hidden from other players. A player can score his own secret objectives but not those belonging to other players.</p>\n\n<p><i>Important:</i> A player cannot have more than three total scored and unscored secret objectives. If he draws a secret objective and has more than three, he must choose one of his unscored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, he shuffles the secret objective deck.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Objective Timing</h3>\n\n<p>Each objective specifies when a player can score it, either during the status phase or during the action phase. This timing is indicated directly below a card's title. If a player scores an objective during the status phase, he must fulfill the requirement on the card during the \"Score Objectives\" step of the status phase to score that objective.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if an objective states that a player must control six planets outside of his home system, he must control those planets when he scores the objective- having controlled those planets earlier is not sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>Players can score some objectives by spending resources, influence, or tokens, as described by the objective card. To score such an objective, a player must pay the specified cost at the time indicated on the card.</p>\n\n<p>If an objective's timing specifies \"Action Phase\", a player can score it during the action phase immediately after he fulfills its requirements.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Scoring Objectives</h3>\n\n<p>If a player fulfills an objective's requirements at the time indicated on the card, he can score it. To do so, he advances his token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the value of the objective card.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/twilight-imperium/game48.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Scoring a Two-Point Objective</h3>\n\n<p>After scoring an objective, a player places a control token from his supply on that objective card to indicate that he has scored it and cannot score it again this game. If he scored a secret objective, he places the card faceup in front of him before placing a control token on it.</p>\n\n<p><b>Important:</b> Each player can only score one public and one secret objective during each status phase and each step of the action phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>The Winner - Imperium Rex</h3>\n\n<p>The game can end early if no player has scored 10 victory points and there are no more objectives to reveal.</p>\n\n<p>When the speaker would reveal an objective but cannot, the game immediately ends and the <b>player with the most victory points wins the game.</b></p>\n\n<p>If there is a tie, the player among the tied players who is earliest in initiative order wins the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Three- And Four-player Games</h3>\n\n<p>When playing the game with three or four players, players implement the following rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><b>The strategy phase:</b> After each player has chosen one strategy card during the strategy phase, players repeat the strategy card selection process until each player has chosen a second strategy card from the available cards.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Initiative order:</b> Each player's lowest-numbered strategy card is used to determine his placement in initiative order.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Passing:</b> A player cannot pass during the action phase unless both of his strategy cards are exhausted.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"tactical-action.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

You will get goods, coins, and victory points via production, trade, development, and by committing to the common good.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The youngest player receives the Start Player Token. <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game22.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>The game is played over 18 rounds, with each round being comprised of 7 phases.</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 1</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game23.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Hour Glass:</b> The Start Player draws the topmost Hour Glass Tile from the stack and turns it face up. The Hour Glass Tiles determine the length of the game.</p>\n\n<p>The game ends at the end of the round in which the 18th and last tile is drawn. Each Hour Glass Tile also introduces an event that will affect the current round.</p>\n\n<p>There are 6 different types of events Except Pilgrimage, events are resolved in Phase 6: \"Event\".</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 2</h3>\n\n<p><b>Census:</b> Determine who has the most and who has the least Farmers. The player whose marker is furthest ahead on the Farmers Track receives 1 coin from the supply. If there is a tie, no player receives the coin.</p>\n\n<p>The player whose marker is furthest behind on the track must pay 1 coin to the supply. If there is a tie, no player has to pay the coin.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game24.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> The blue player receives a coin and the red player must pay a coin.</p>\n\n<p><b>Please note:</b> In the 2-player game, the player who is behind on the track does not have to pay a coin. The player who is ahead still receives a coin.</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 3</h3>\n\n<p><b>Followers:</b> Draw Character Tiles from your Followers Bag and place them on the Market. You may draw a number of Character Tiles from your bag equal to or lower than the number indicated by your marker on the Knights Track.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the game, this number is 4. Place the drawn tiles on the Market Spaces of your Player Board. You may not draw more tiles than you can fit in your Market.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> Character Tiles that you do not use remain on your Market, thus taking up space that you might need when drawing tiles.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game25.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> The green player may draw 4 tiles from his bag. The yellow and blue player may each draw 6 tiles, and the red player may even draw 8 tiles from his bag.</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 4</h3>\n\n<p><b>Planning:</b> You may use the Character Tiles from your Market to activate actions in Places. You may leave Character Tiles on your Market to use them in subsequent rounds.</p>\n\n<p>Each Place provides a specific action and requires a certain set of Character Tiles to activate. (Some Place Tiles only require a single tile for activation or none at all).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game26.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> You need a boatman and a craftsman to receive another farmer.</p>\n\n<p>Place the required Character Tiles on the corresponding Action Spaces of the Place you want to activate. A Place is considered activated as soon as all of its Action Spaces have a tile. You can carry out the action during the following or during a future Action Phase.</p>\n\n<p>You are not required to place all required tiles during the same Planning Phase. You may place some now and the rest in subsequent rounds. As long as you have not placed all of the required tiles, you have not activated the action and may not play it.</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 5</h3>\n\n<p><b>Actions:</b> You may carry out the actions of the Places you activated, i.e. where you placed a Follower (or Technology Tile) on every required space.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with the Start Player and in clockwise order, each player may carry out 1 action or pass. If you pass, you cannot carry out any more actions during that round.</p>\n\n<p>After you played an action, remove the Followers from that action (e.g. the Boatman and the Craftsman from the Farm House) and put them back into your bag.</p>\n\n<p><b>Please note:</b> Technology Tiles remain on the Action Spaces you placed them until the end of the game.</p>\n\n<p>You may carry out your actions in any order. You are not required to carry out an activated action. You may pass even if you could carry out more actions.</p>\n\n<p>The Action Phase ends when all players have passed. If you pass, you cannot participate in the current Action Phase anymore. Activated actions that you did not use this round remain activated and can be used in a subsequent round. Do not remove Character Tiles from actions you have not used yet.</p>\n\n<h3>Phase 6</h3>\n\n<p>Event: Resolve the event shown on the Hour Glass Tile of this round. (The event affects all players. See below for details on the events).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game27.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Phase 7</h3>\n\n<p>Start Player: The current Start Player passes the Start Player Token to the player to his left.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game22.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The Actions/Places</h2>\n\n<p><b>Every Place represents a specific action.</b> Your Player Board features the most common Places. As the game progresses, you can acquire additional Places.</p>\n\n<p>You can play an action if it is activated (all spaces occupied). After you played an action, you remove the Character Tiles (but not the Technology Tiles) used to activate it and return them to your Followers Bag.</p>\n\n<p>The Places and their actions in detail:</p>\n\n<h3>Farm House</h3>\n\n<p>Take a <b>Farmer Tile</b> from the Farm House on the game board and put the Farmer into your bag.</p>\n\n<p>Then advance your marker one space on the Farmers Track and receive the depicted good. The position of your marker on this track also plays a role during Phase 2: \"Census\".</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game30.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Village</h3>\n\n<p>In the Village, you can receive another <b>Boatman, Craftsman, or Trader</b>. You can choose one of the following actions (Boatman, Craftsman, Trader):</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"white\">\n\n<h4>1.boatman</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game32.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Take a <b>Boatman Tile</b> from the game board and put it into your Followers Bag. Then advance one space on the Boatmen Track and receive the depicted number of coins.</p>\n\n<p>On the last space of that track, the first player to get there receives a Citizen Tile instead of coins.</p>\n\n<h4>2.craftsman</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game35.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Take a <b>Craftsman Tile</b> from the game board and put it into your Followers Bag. Then advance one space on the Craftsmen Track and receive a Technology Tile.</p>\n\n<p>Put the Technology Tile next to your Player Board. You may only use it after you pass.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game37.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Technology:</b> You can place the Technology Tile on an Action Space of your choice to replace the required Character Tile for the rest of the game.</p>\n\n<p>You do not remove the Technology Tile after you played the action. It remains on its space until the end of the game.</p>\n\n<p><b>Constraints:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first Technology Tile you place in a game must replace a Farmer.</li>\n<li>Subsequent Technology Tiles may replace any Character Tile except Monks.</li>\n<li>Monks can never be replaced with Technology Tiles.</li>\n<li>You may not place more than 1 Technology Tile at one Place.</li>\n<li>You may not place a Technology Tile at a Place that only requires a single Character Tile.</li>\n<li>You may not move a Technology Tile after you placed it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>3. Trader</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game36.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Take a <b>Trader Tile</b> from the game board and put it into your Followers Bag. Then advance one space on the Traders Track and expand your city with a Place Tile.</p>\n\n<p><b>Expanding the City:</b> You may choose a Place Tile. There are two types of Place Tiles, I and II. When you advance on the Traders Track for the first time, you may only choose a tile from stack I.</p>\n\n<p>Every other time you advance on the track, you may choose a tile from stack I or II. Place the chosen Place Tile next to your Player Board. You now have another Place you can activate or use its special ability.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> The players may look through the stacks of Place Tiles at any time.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>University</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game34.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Take a <b>Scholar Tile</b>f rom the game board and put it into your Followers Bag. Then advance one space on the Scholars Track and receive the depicted number of Development Points. For each Development Point you receive during the game, advance your marker one space on the Development Track.</p>\n\n<h3>Castle</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game33.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Take a <b>Knight Tile</b> from the game board and put it into your Followers Bag. Then advance one space on the Knights Track. The Knights Track indicates how many Followers you may draw from your bag and place on your Market in Phase 3.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the game, you may draw 4 Followers each round. You can increase this number by recruiting Knights.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> When you get your fourth Knight, this number (7) does not increase, but you may receive a Citizen Tile if you are the first player to get there.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> Once your marker moves onto the last space of a track, you may no longer take the corresponding action.</p>\n\n<h3>Monastery</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game31.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Take a <b>Monk Tile</b> from the game board and put it into your Followers Bag. There is no additional bonus like with the other actions.</p>\n\n<p>Monks can be used in place of any of the other Character Tiles. (However, the inverse is not true. You cannot use another Character Tile or a Technology Tile in place of a Monk).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game41.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Ship</h3>\n\n<p>Move your Merchant Token from its current location along a Waterway (blue connection) to an adjacent town. If there is a Goods Tile on the way, you may take it. If there are multiple goods, you may take one of them. Place the Goods Tile next to your Player Board.</p>\n\n<h3>Wagon</h3>\n\n<p>This action is similar to the \"Ship\" action, but rather than moving along a Waterway, move your Merchant Token along a Road (brown connection).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Guildhall</h2>\n\n<p>Build a Trading Station in the town in which your Merchant Token is present if there is no Trading Station in that town already (regardless of which player it belongs to). Each town can only have one Trading Station.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: In Orleans, each player may build one Trading Station.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Scriptorium</h2>\n\n<p>You receive 1 Development Point. Advance your marker one space on the Development Track.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game48.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Town Hall</h2>\n\n<p>During the Planning Phase, you can place 1 or 2 Character Tiles in the Town Hall. (The Town Hall does not require both spaces be occupied in order to activate).</p>\n\n<p>When using the \"Town Hall\" action, move one or both Character Tiles from the Town Hall to any free appropriate spaces on the \"Beneficial Deeds\" board. You receive the depicted reward (1, 2, or 3 coins, and in case of Canalization 1 coin or 1 Development Point) for each character.</p>\n\n<p>When you complete a Beneficial Deed (i.e. you place a tile on the last remaining unoccupied space), you receive the Citizen Tile of that Beneficial Deed.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot replace the Character Tiles required for Beneficial Deeds with other tiles (like Monks). You must always use the exact Character Tiles as shown on the spaces. Character Tiles used for Beneficial Deeds remain there for the rest of the game.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game49.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Please note: You may not place the Followers of your color (i.e. your initial Farmer, Boatman, Craftsman, and Trader) in the Town Hall.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game51.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The Development Track</h2>\n\n<p>Some spaces of the Development Track show coins or contain a Citizen Tile. If you move your marker onto or past a space with coins, you receive the depicted amount of coins from the supply. If you are the first player to move onto or past a space with a Citizen Tile, you receive that tile.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game52.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><b>Development Status Spaces</b> indicate your state of development. If you move onto or past such a space, your Development Status immediately becomes the depicted value. At the beginning of the game, this value is 1.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> Your Development Status affects the \"Income\" event (you receive a number of coins equal to your Development Status), the Hospital, as well as the victory point value of your Citizen Tiles and Trading Stations at the end of the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends after 18 rounds. Before you proceed with the scoring, the player who has built the most Trading Stations receives the remaining Citizen Tile. If there is a tie, no player receives the tile. Then determine your final scores. You score victory points (VP) for:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/orleans/game54.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n<ul>\n<li><b>Coins:</b> 1 VP per coin</li>\n<li><b>Brocade:</b> 5 VP</li>\n<li><b>Wool:</b> 4 VP</li>\n<li><b>Wine:</b> 3 VP</li>\n<li><b>Cheese:</b> 2 VP</li>\n<li><b>Grain:</b> 1 VP</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Trading Stations and Citizen Tiles:</b> Each Trading Station you have built and every Citizen Tile you have collected is worth a number of VP equal to your Development Status.</p>\n\n<p>The player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, the player further ahead on the Development Track wins. If still tied, there are multiple winners.</p>\n\n<p><i>(Example:</i> Klemens has built 5 Trading Stations and collected 2 Citizen Tiles. His current Development Status is 4, as indicated by the Development Track. He receives (5+2) x 4 = 28 VP).</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Torture (Bankruptcy)</h2>\n\n<p>Every time you must pay something (e.g. during Census or Taxes) and you cannot do so, you must undergo torture. You must replace every missing coin with something else from this list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a Trading Station (an already built one or one from your supply)</li>\n<li>a Follower (draw a random one from your bag; as long as you draw a Follower of your color, put the Follower back into the bag and draw again)</li>\n<li>a Development Point (move your marker on the Development Track one space to the left, but not onto or past a space with coins)</li>\n<li>a Goods Tile</li>\n<li>a Place Tile</li>\n<li>a Technology Tile</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may replace missing coins with any mix of items from this list (e.g. if you owe 5 coins, you may replace them with 1 Follower, 2 Trading Stations, and 2 Development Points).</p>\n\n<p>All items lost in this process are removed from the game. Only Development Points can be re-gained.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h4>General Rules of the Game</h4>\n\n<br>\n\n<h5>Running Out Of Tiles:</h5>\n\n<p>Character, Technology, and Goods Tiles are limited in this game. You cannot gain a tile if it is not available anymore. When you run out of a particular tile, you can no longer play an action that provides that tile.</p>\n\n<p>Events may result in certain tiles becoming available again (Harvest, Plague). When this happens, you can play the corresponding actions again. When there are not enough coins in the supply (temporarily), players cannot receive coins (at the moment).</p>\n\n<h5>Checking On Your Followers</h5>\n\n<p>At any time during the game, you may look into your bag to see how many and which Followers you have in there. (When you fi nish looking, shuffl e the tiles in your bag so that you cannot draw particular tiles on purpose).</p>\n\n<h5>Empty Roads Or Waterways</h5>\n\n<p>You may use empty Roads and Waterways. You just do not receive a good.</p>\n\n<h5>Marked Followers</h5>\n\n<p>The marked Followers of your color (which you received during setup) always remain with you (either in your bag or on your board). You cannot use them for Beneficial Deeds nor lose them to the Plague nor pay with them during Torture.</p>\n\n<h5>Placed Character Tiles</h5>\n\n<p>You cannot move a Character Tile from one Action Space to another. However, when drawing Followers from your bag during Phase 3: \"Followers\", for each Follower that you decline to draw, you may move a Character Tile from an Action Space to your Market. (Example: Stefan may draw 6 Followers. He only draws 4 Followers and moves 2 Followers from Action Spaces to his Market).</p>\n\n<h5>Payments</h5>\n\n<p>Pay coins into the general supply and take coins from there when you receive them.</p>\n\n<h4>Turn Order</h4>\n\n<p>Most phases can be played simultaneously. In Phase 4 (Planning), start planning at the same time. Then tell the other players when you are done planning. If need be, do this in turn order, i.e. beginning with the Start Player and in clockwise order. Likewise, resolve payments in that same order.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"events.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

This is 1 considered the game board. When playing for the first time, we recommend you use the \"Short paths\" layout, in which the Place tiles are laid out according to their blue numbers as shown below.</p>\n\n<p>Note: In a 2-player game: place the Merchant discs of the unused colors on the Mosques 14 15 and the Gemstone Dealer 16.</p>\n\n<p>Randomly determine a Start player. He gets 2 Lira and the Starting player marker. In clockwise order, each other player gets 1 more Lira than the player to his right. Then each player draws a Bonus card from the top of the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Sort the Mosque tiles by color and then by their number of goods symbols in 4 stacks (so that the tile on top of each stack shows 2 symbols) and place them on the two Mosques 14 15. Place 1 Ruby per player on each of the Mosques.</p>\n\n<p>Note: With 5 players: Only place 4 Rubies on each of the Mosques. With 3 players: Remove the tiles with 5 symbols from the game. With 2 players: Remove the tiles with 3 and 5 symbols from the game.</p>\n\n<p>Per player, place 1 Ruby and 3 Wheelbarrow extensions on the Wainwright 1. Place Rubies on the Gemstone Dealer 16 and the Sultan's Palace 13 beginning with the top space on the right.</p>\n\n<p>Continue to the space for the appropriate number of players. Place 1 Ruby on each space and leave the remaining spaces empty.</p>\n\n<p>Place the Mail indicators in the top row of the Post Office 5. Shuffle the 5 dark Demand tiles and place them face-up in a stack on the Large Market 10. Repeat this procedure for the Small Market 11 using the light Demand tiles.</p>\n\n<p>Determine the starting Places of the Governor and the Smuggler. For each of them, roll both dice and place the token on the Place tile with the appropriate number.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the Bonus cards and place them face-down in a stack as well as the coins and dice next to the game board. Each player chooses a color and takes the wooden components in that color.</p>\n\n<p>Also, take a Wheelbarrow and an Overview and place them in front of you.</p>\n\n<p>Place the 4 Goods indicators on the grey spaces of your Wheelbarrow. Place your Family members on the Police Station 12. Stack your 4 Assistant discs and place your Merchant disc on top of this stack. Then place these stacks on the Fountain 7. Place the 5th Assistant of each player easily accessible next to the game board.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tutorial Video</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZEOD3Wdlucg?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game play</h2>\n\n<p>Beginning with the Start player you take turns in clockwise order.</p>\n\n<p>When the first player has collected 5 Rubies (in a 2-player game: 6 Rubies) on the appropriate spaces of his Wheelbarrow, you complete the current round. After this round the game ends.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h2>Game Turn</h2>\n\n<p>A turn consists of 4 phases but, most of the time, only the 2 phases \"Movement\" and \"Action\" are actually played.</p>\n\n<p>The other phases, the so-called \"Encounters\"(blue background below), will only take place when your Merchant encounters other tokens.</p>\n\n<p>On your turn, you may use any number of Bonus cards and the special abilities of your Mosque tiles.</p>\n\n<p>You must always go through the following phases in the given order regardless of whether you go through all of them or not!</p>\n\n<h3>I. Movement</h3>\n\n<p>Move your Merchant and the stack of Assistants under him (if any) by 1 or 2 Places. You may not move diagonally and you must end up on a different Place than you started at.</p>\n\n<p>You then have the following three options at the Merchant's Target Place:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p><b>Pick up an Assistant</b></p>\n<li><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/movement1.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If one of your Assistants was present at the target place already, put your stack on top of that Assistant (see fig. on the right). He will leave that place as part of the stack during the next Movement phase.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Leave an Assistant behind</b></p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/movement2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If none of your Assistants was present at the target place, remove the bottommost Assistant from your stack and place him next to it. He will be left behind at that place during the next Movement phase.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you cannot or do not want to pick up an Assistant or leave one behind, your turn ends immediately (exception: Fountain 7).</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: If you have the yellow Mosque tile, you may pay 2 Lira to take an Assistant back from another Place and add him to your Merchant stack.</p>\n\n<h3>II. Encounters with other Merchants</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/encounters.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If there are any other Merchants at the Target Place, you have to pay each of them 2 Lira. Your turn ends immediately if you cannot or do not want to pay.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: You don't have to pay other Merchants at the Fountain 7.</p>\n\n<p>Special case in a 2-player game: If you encounter a neutral Merchant (ie of an unused color), pay the 2 Lira into the general supply. Then roll both dice to determine a new position for this neutral Merchant and place him there.</p>\n\n<h3>III. Action</h3>\n\n<p>You may carry out the action that the target place provides. If you cannot or do not want to carry it out, you may proceed with phase 4 (Encounters).</p>\n\n<h3>IV. Encounters with ...</h3>\n\n<h4>other Family members</h4>\n\n<p>If there are other players' Family members at the Target Place, you must catch them and send them all to the Police Station 12 (unless they are there already).</p>\n\n<p>As a reward for catching them, you may take 1 Bonus card or 3 Lira from the general supply for each such Family member. If you catch more than 1 Family member, you may take a different or the same reward for each of them (you do not get any reward in the Police Station).</p>\n\n<h4>the Governor</h4>\n\n<p>You may draw 1 Bonus card from the face-down stack and put it into your hand. If you do, either pay 2 Lira or discard 1 Bonus card from your hand.</p>\n\n<h4>the Smuggler</h4>\n\n<p>You may gain 1 good of your choice.</p>\n\n<p>If you do, either pay 2 Lira or 1 good.</p>\n\n<p>If you used the ability of the Governor or Smuggler, roll both dice and place the appropriate token on the Place indicated by the result of the dice roll (according to the large brown number). Roll separately if you used them both.</p>\n\n<p>Note: You may discard the Bonus card or pay the good you received from the Governor or Smuggler in order to move them.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Bonus Cards</h2>\n\n<p>On your turn, you may play any number of Bonus cards. Place every used or discarded Bonus card on the face-up discard pile on the Caravansary 6.</p>\n\n<p>When taking a Bonus card, draw it from the face-down draw pile (exception: Caravansary 6). Shuffle the discard pile to form a new face-down draw pile as soon as the draw pile runs out. You may keep any number of Bonus cards in your hand.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/bonuscards.jpg\" class=\" border\">\n\n<br><br>\n<h2>Places and their actions</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/wainwright.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Wainwright</h3>\n\n<p>Pay 7 Lira into the general supply to take a Wheelbarrow extension from the Wainwright and place it in your Wheelbarrow.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as you complete your Wheelbarrow, i.e. once you have extended it for the 3rd time, immediately and only once take 1 Ruby off the Wainwright and place it on your Wheelbarrow.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/fabric.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Fabric/Spice/Fruit Warehouse</h3>\n\n<p>Move the Goods indicator of the respective good as far to the right as possible. If you have the green Mosque tile, you may pay 2 Lira to gain 1 additional good of any type.</p>\n\n<h3>Post Office</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/postoffice.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You receive the resources that are depicted on the 4 uncovered spaces. Then move the leftmost Mail indicator of the top row down to the bottom row. If all Mail indicators are already in the bottom row, move them all back to the top row.</p>\n\n<p>Example: You receive 3 Lira, 1 yellow and 1 red good. Then you move the Mail indicator off the blue good onto the yellow one.</p>\n\n<h3>Caravansary</h3>\n\n<p>Take 2 Bonus cards into your hand and discard 1 Bonus card from your hand.</p>\n\n<p>Note: When taking Bonus cards with this action (and only with this one), you may also take them from the top of the face-up discard pile.</p>\n\n<h3>Fountain</h3>\n\n<p>Return any number of your Assistants to your Merchant stack.</p>\n\n<p>The Fountain is the only Place where you do not need to have an Assistant there to carry out the action and you do not have to pay other Merchants if they are present.</p>\n\n<p>If you send your Family Member to the Fountain, your Assistants are still returned to your Merchant stack.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/blackmarket.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Black Market</h3>\n\n<p>Gain 1 red or 1 yellow or 1 green good. Roll both dice: If you rolled 7 or 8: Gain 1 blue good. If you rolled 9 or 10: Gain 2 blue goods. If you rolled 11 or 12: Gain 3 blue goods.</p>\n\n<p>You may also roll the dice first and gain the one additional good afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the red Mosque tile, you may turn one die to \"4\" after the roll or re-roll both dice.</p>\n\n<h3>Tea House</h3>\n\n<p>Announce a number between 3 and 12. Then roll both dice. If you roll equal to or greater than the announced number, take the announced number of Lira from the general supply.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, only take 2 Lira.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the red Mosque tile, you may turn one die to \"4\" after the roll or re-roll both dice.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/market.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Small/Large Market</h3>\n\n<p>Sell 1-5 of the goods that are depicted on the Demand tile. Move the Goods indicators on your Wheelbarrow accordingly. Then take the revenue from the general supply according to the table.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, move the current Demand tile to the bottom of the stack.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/police.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Police Station</h3>\n\n<p>If your Family member is in the Police Station, \"free\" it and send it to another Place. Then carry out the action of that Place. Your Family member does not have any encounters.</p>\n\n<p>While at other Places, your Family member may be caught by other Merchants and sent back to the Police Station. As a reward, the catching player will get 1 Bonus card or 3 Lira.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/sultan.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Sultan's Palace</h3>\n\n<p>Deliver all the goods that are not covered by a Ruby to the Sultan.</p>\n\n<p>As a reward, take the next available Ruby from the track and place it on your Wheelbarrow. Consequently, the next Ruby will be more expensive.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/mosque.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Small/Great Mosque</h3>\n\n<p>Take 1 Mosque tile. To do so, your Wheelbarrow must carry the goods that are depicted on the Mosque tile in the required quantities.</p>\n\n<p>Then pay 1 of the depicted goods. Each Mosque tile provides a special ability (see below or blue texts). You may only have one copy of each tile.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as you acquire both tiles of one Mosque, immediately and only once take 1 Ruby from that Mosque and place it on your Wheelbarrow.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/gemstone.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Gemstone Dealer</h3>\n\n<p>Pay a number of Lira into the general supply equal to the biggest number that is not covered by a Ruby.</p>\n\n<p>Then take the next available Ruby from the track and place it on your Wheelbarrow. Consequently, the next Ruby will be more expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Example: The biggest number that is not covered by a Ruby is 15. So you have to pay 15 Lira to get the next Ruby from the track.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Mosque Tiles</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/redtile.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Red tile</b></p>\n\n<p>At the Tea House 9 and the Black Market 8 , you may turn 1 die to \"4\" after the roll or re-roll both dice (1x).</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/bluetile.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Blue tile</b>\n\n</p><p>Immediately take the 5th Assistant of your color from the general supply and place him under your Merchant.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/greentile.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Green tile</b></p>\n\n<p>When using one of the three Warehouses 2 3 4 , you may pay 2 Lira to gain 1 additional good of any type.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/yellowtile.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Yellow tile</b></p>\n\n<p>Once on your turn, you may pay 2 Lira to return an Assistant to your Merchant stack.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/istanbul/box.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The first player to collect 5 Rubies (in a 2-player game: 6 Rubies) triggers the end of the game.</p>\n\n<p>When this happens, complete the current round. Then each player may use his leftover Bonus cards that provide goods or money. This may matter for the tie-breaker.</p>\n\n<p>The player with the most Rubies wins.</p>\n\n<p>Ties are broken in the following order: most leftover Lira, most leftover goods on the Wheelbarrow, most leftover Bonus cards. If these have not resolved the tie, there are multiple winners.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"buy-istanbul.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Rubies are a valuable and highly flexible good: you can trade them for other goods and landscape tiles at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Outside your caves, you will look after your sustenance by felling trees, raising farm animals and doing some agriculture.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, the wealthiest dwarf will win.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/components.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n<ul>\n<li>300+ wooden pieces for animals, resources and dwarfs</li>\n<li>60+ acrylic nuggets for ore and ruby</li>\n<li>7 large Home boards</li>\n<li>1 small and large basic game board</li>\n<li>1 small and large additional game board</li>\n<li>1 two-sided basic game board</li>\n<li>4 longish supply boards</li>\n<li>16 punchboards with over 400 pieces</li>\n<li>30 cards</li>\n<li>1 score sheet</li>\n<li>1 rulebook</li>\n<li>1 appendix</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<h4>Your Personal Playing Areas</h4>\n\n<p>Each player chooses a color and takes the Home board and the 5 Dwarfs and 3 Stables of that color.</p>\n\n<p>Place 2 of the 5 Dwarfs side by side in the \"Entry- level dwelling\" on your Home board. Keep the remaining 3 Dwarfs and Stables next to your Home board as your personal supply.</p>\n\n<p>(Return the Dwarfs, Stables and Home boards of the leftover colors to the game box).</p>\n\n<p>Then take one of each of the 2 different Overview cards.</p>\n\n<p>Randomly determine the player who gets the Starting player token. The Starting player and the player to his left each get 1 Food. The third player gets 2 Food. Each other player gets 3 Food.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game1.jpg\"><br>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>We recommend you cover the Dwarfs in your supply with Stables to avoid using them by accident before you are allowed to.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Players get a different number of Food depending on their position in the turn order.</p>\n\n<h4>The Game Boards With Action Spaces</h4>\n\n<p>Place the two single -sided basic game boards with Round spaces 1 to 3 and 4 to 12 next to each other.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the 7 Harvest markers and place them face -down (with the grey rune symbol facing up) on the Round spaces 6 to 12, one marker per space. Place the \"Harvest events\" card next to the game boards.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game9.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>In a 2-player game, remove one of the Harvest markers with a green leaf from the game. Then distribute the remaining 6 markers among the Round spaces 6 to 12 leaving space 9 empty.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game10.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Place the third basic game board to the left of the first two. Turn it to the appropriate side depending on the number of players (1 to 3, or 4 to 7 players).</p>\n\n<p>There are two additional game boards.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In games with 5 to 7 players, the larger additional game board is used. Turn it to the appropriate side depending on the number of players (5, or 6 to 7 players).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The smaller additional game board is used in games with 3 or 7 players.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Place the required additional game boards to the left of the basic ones.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game11.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>The Supply Boards and Furnishing Tiles</h4>\n\n<p>The supply boards are double-sided. One side is used in the Introductory game, the other side is used in the Full game. The Full game comes with a larger variety of Furnishing tiles. (Put the unused Furnishing tiles back into the game box when playing an Introductory game).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>When playing with 6 or 7 players, we recommend that you start with the Full that you start with the Full game to make sure that there is a sufficient number of Furnishing tiles in play.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Place the Furnishing tiles on the appropriate spaces on the supply boards. There is more than one ordinary \"Dwelling\" tile. Place some of them on the appropriate space on the supply board and keep the rest next to it as a reserve.</p>\n\n<p>There is a sufficient number of ordinary \"Dwelling\" tiles (costing 4 wood and 3 stone). You do not need to put all of them on the supply board. Replenish them incrementally from time to time when needed.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game13.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>The Action Space Cards</h4>\n\n<p>Shuffle the 12 Action space cards. Keep them face-down while shuffling.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>In the 2-player game, only 11 Action space cards are used. Remove the \"Exploration\" card with the \"Level 4 expedition\" from the game. (Cover the unused Round space 9 with a Dwarf card).</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rearrange the shuffled Action space cards into a face-down stack as follows without looking at them.</p>\n\n<p>The 12 Action space cards rearranged after shuffling. You can fan them out or keep them in a stack.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game14.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Put the three stage 4 cards at the bottom of the stack, on top of them the three (or two) stage 3 cards, and on top of those the two ordinary stage 2 cards.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Put the card for round 4 on top of these. (This card says \"Wish for children \" on one side and \"Urgent wish for children\" on the other side. Right now it does not matter which side faces up).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Finally, put the three stage 1 cards on top of the stack.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>The Landscape Tiles</h4>\n\n<p>Sort the landscape tiles by type and put them in separate stacks. There are 3 types of both, single tiles and twin tiles.</p>\n\n<h4>The Building Materials, Animals and Weapon Strength Markers</h4>\n\n<p>Separate the remaining components and keep them in separate piles next to the game boards. All the animals may be kept in one pile and all the building materials in another. You do not need to sort the Weapon strength markers by number.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game12.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>You will place single and twin tiles on your Home boards during the course of the game. Fields and Meadows (which can be further upgraded to Pastures) can be placed on Forest spaces; Caverns and Tunnels (which can be further upgraded to Mines) can be placed on Mountain spaces.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game8.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Your Home board consists of two parts (see below). On the left side, there is a Forest that you will cut down during the course of the game.</p>\n\n<p>On the right side, there is a Mountain with an entrance to your cave system, which currently consists of two Caverns.</p>\n\n<p>One of these is the \"Entry-level dwelling\" and has been furnished for 2 Dwarfs and a pair of animals. The other Cavern is still empty, but is ready to be furnished.</p>\n\n<p>Your first two Dwarfs live in the entry-level room of your cave system. If you want to grow your Dwarf family, you will need to add more Dwellings. There are Furnishing tiles for this purpose as you have already seen during setup.</p>\n\n<p>Each of your Dwarfs may take one action per round - the available actions are displayed on the game boards. You will place your Dwarfs, one at a time, in clockwise order on Action spaces until all players have placed their Dwarfs on the game boards.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of your actions is to collect Food for your Dwarfs and to develop your Home board to be worth a lot of Gold points at the end of the game. Let us have a look at what you can do with your Home board and what you get Gold points for.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>Caverns can be furnished like the one at the bottom of this illustration or they can be empty like the one at the top. Dwellings are special types of furnished Caverns. There are a lot of other ways to furnish a Cavern.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When placing your Dwarfs on the game boards, you will eventually get in one another's way. Each Action space may only be occupied by a single Dwarf. The Dwarfs only return home after they have all been placed. Then they are placed again in the next round.</p>\n\n<p>While reading the rules, you may come back to the following section every now and then to get a better view of the context. This section is not required for understanding the rules. Any information found here is also explained elsewhere in the rule book.</p>\n\n<h4>To get a grasp of what happens on your home boards</h4>\n\n<p>You cut the Forest on your Home board to get Wood and cut through the Mountain to get Stone. You need these building materials to furnish the hollowed out spaces of your Mountain. Outside the Mountain, you can use the cleared Forest land to do agriculture and raise Farm animals to feed your little family.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game16.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game7.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Weapons And Expeditions</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game17.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Veteran \"Agricola\" players may be highly interested in what the Weapons are for. In Caverna, your Dwarfs gather Ore to forge Weapons. The strength of a Weapon is determined by the amount of Ore used in the process and is increased by 1 after each Expedition.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on its level, an Expedition may yield 1 to 4 loot items. What these items will be depends on the strength of the Weapon that has been used (see the Overview card).</p>\n\n<p>A newly forged Weapon can only have an initial strength equal to or lower than 8. This strength can be increased over the course of the game to the maximum strength value of 14.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game20.jpg\"><br>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>The special thing about the 'Cave Farmers' is the two groups that emerge when playing with a lot of players: one group goes after Weapons, the other one pursues the peaceful route.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the same group, of course, will compete for the same resources. Be vigilant about the competition within your group, so you do not lose against the other one.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"white\">\n\n<h4>Number Of Components</h4>\n\n<p>The only components that are purposely limited in number (apart from the unique Furnishing tiles) are the 5 Dwarfs and 3 Stables of each player. Any other components are considered to be unlimited. If you run out of any such component, use the Multiplication markers or improvise. Put a good token on a Multiplication marker to indicate 4 tokens of that type.</p>\n\n<p>There are markers depicting 8 animals of a specific type. These can be used on Large pastures with a Stable. Also, there are markers for 10 units of a specific type of building material or for 5 Rubies.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game21.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>You can \"multiply\" animals as well. This Large pasture is currently holding 4 Wild boars.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Let us have a look at the Scoring Pad</h4>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, the player with the most Gold points wins. In the following example, we will have a look at the ways you can score points. The numbers in parentheses are the points gained in the example.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game22.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>This section consists of two parts. At first, we will look at the course of a round. Then we will explain the actions.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Turn</h2>\n\n<p>Each of the 12 rounds goes through five phases that are played one after another in the order described here.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>In the 2-player game, there are only 11 rounds to play.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>Players who have already played 'Agricola' only need to read the brown sentences. All the other rules are the same in both 'Caverna' and 'Agricola'.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The five phases of a turn are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Add a new Action space</h5>\n\n<p>At the beginning of each round, turn over the top Action space card and put it on the appropriate space on the basic game boards.</p>\n\n<p>This is where you will place the first Action space card in Round 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Replenish accumulating spaces</h5>\n\n<p>Place goods from the general supply on the Action spaces that require them. These Action spaces show an arrow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Work phase</h5>\n\n<p>In clockwise order, take turns to place 1 Dwarf per turn on an Action space on the game boards. Then carry out the actions on that space. Each Action space may only be occupied by a single Dwarf.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Return home</h5>\n\n<p>After all Dwarfs have been placed on Action spaces, return your Dwarfs to their Dwellings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game26.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h5>Harvest time</h5>\n\n<p>At the end of most of the rounds, there is a harvest: collect Grain and Vegetables, feed your family, and breed your animals.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2>1. Add a New Action Space</h2>\n\n<p>Turn over the top Action space card from the stack and put it on the empty Round space with the lowest number. (The Round spaces are numbered 1 to 12).</p>\n\n<p>The new Action space adds to the number of available actions. It can be used by any player in the Work phase of this and all subsequent rounds.</p>\n\n<p>From the start of round 6, you must also turn the Harvest marker on the Round space where the new Action space card is placed face-up. Leave the marker on the grey rune space.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game29.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>The first Round space reminds you to check if you need additional game boards</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game30.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>There is a grey rune symbol on the back side of each Harvest marker, and a green leaf or red question mark on the front side.</p>\n\n<p>If the Harvest marker shows a green leaf, there will be a normal harvest at the end of the round.</p>\n\n<p>If it shows a red question mark, the harvest will be played differently.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"white\">\n\n<h5>Special Cases When Adding A New Action Space</h5>\n\n<p>The \"Wish for children\" Action space card will always come into play in round 4. Initially, place it with the \"Wish for children\" side facing up on the game board. Turn it to the other side that says \"Urgent wish for children\" as soon as you add the \"Family life\" Action space card in stage 3.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game31.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>That's the way it is with small families: Over time a wish for children will become an urgent wish.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>In the 2-player game, the last round of stage 3 - round 9 - is skipped, as the \"Exploration\" Action space card was removed from the game.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>2. Replenish Accumulating Spaces</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game34.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>On many Action spaces, there is a special arrow and a background illustration indicating that this space has to be replenished with goods every round. These Action spaces are called \"accumulating spaces\".</p>\n\n<p>Accumulating spaces have to be replenished even if there are goods left on them from previous rounds. \"3 Wood\" and an arrow, for instance, indicate that you put 3 Wood on that Action space every round.</p>\n\n<p>There is an exception: \"3 (1) Wood\" and an arrow, for instance, indicate that you put 1 Wood on that Action space every round - unless that Action space is empty, in which case you put 3 Wood on it. Read the icons of other Action spaces accordingly. \"1 Grain (1 Vegetable)\" on the \"Sustenance\" Action space, for instance, means you have to put 1 Grain on that space if it is empty, and 1 Vegetable instead if not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>Details on replenishing accumulating spaces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When replenishing, take the required goods from the general supply.</li>\n<li>There is no upper limit for the number of goods on an accumulating space.</li>\n<li>If you run out of a specific good, use the Multiplication markers or improvise (see page 5)</li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>3. Work Phase</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game35.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Beginning with the Starting player and in clockwise order, take turns to pick up a single Dwarf from your cave and place it on an unoccupied Action space. Then carry out the depicted action immediately. Play continues until all Dwarfs of all players have been placed in this fashion.</p>\n\n<p>Please note the play order of Dwarfs: You have to place your Dwarfs in ascending order of their Weapon strength, beginning with your unarmed Dwarfs (i.e. those without a Weapon) and followed by your armed ones (i.e. those bearing a Weapon).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game36.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Each Action space can only be used by one Dwarf in a round.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game37.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Whenever you take building materials, Grain, Vegetables, Food or Rubies, the tokens are placed in your personal supply in view of the other players. Animals may not be placed in your supply; they must be placed directly on your Home board.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>Details on the Work Phase</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Animals that you gain during the Work phase but that you cannot or do not want to accommodate on your Home board may be converted into Food immediately (according to the conversion table on your Home board).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You can only place Dwarfs from your cave. You may not use the Dwarfs in your personal supply (as they have not been born yet, if you will, but they can be introduced later).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>On your turn, you can only ever place one Dwarf at a time.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You may not place a Dwarf on an Action space without performing at least one of its actions.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Due to the \"Family growth\" action (see page 15), some players may have fewer Dwarfs than others in their caves. If a player runs out of Dwarfs during a round, this player is skipped. Only the players that have Dwarfs left in their caves continue to play them one by one as described.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>On some Action spaces you have to choose one out of several options (\"either ... or\").</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Other Action spaces allow you to take any number of the available actions (\"and/or\", \"and then/or\").</p></li>\n\n<li><p>There are two Action spaces that have a mandatory primary action and an optional follow-up action (\"and then\"). In case of the \"Urgent wish for children\" Action space, you have to use the first action in order to use the second one at all.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>4. Return Home</h2>\n\n<p>Remove your Dwarfs from the game boards and return them to their Dwellings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>Details on Returning Home</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It does not matter how you distribute the Dwarfs among the Dwellings in your cave system.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You may never have more Dwarfs in play than available room in your cave. This is why each of your tired Dwarfs will always find a place to sleep.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>It is best to place your Dwarfs side by side in your cave so that your opponents can easily see which of your Dwarfs have a Weapon and what strengths these Weapons have.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>5. Harvest Time</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game41.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>During the Harvest time, players have to sustain their families. Some rounds do not end with a harvest, others do. A harvest goes through three sub-phases that are played in the following order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Sub-phase 1: <b>The Field phase</b>.</h5>\n\n<p>Remove 1 Grain or Vegetable token from each sown Field on your Home board and place it in your personal supply. (See page 14 for information on how to grow crops).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Sub-phase 2: <b>The Feeding phase</b>.</h5>\n\n<p>In the Feeding phase, you have to feed your Dwarfs by paying 2 Food per Dwarf in your cave. Offspring that were born during the current round from a \"Family growth\" action only consume 1 Food for this round, but will require 2 Food in future harvests.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not have enough Food, you may convert goods into Food or you will have to take Begging markers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h4>Begging Markers</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game42.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If you cannot or do not wish to produce the required Food, you must take 1 Begging marker for each missing Food. You may not give up Dwarfs to avoid the need to feed them.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, you will lose 3 Gold points for each Begging marker. There is no way to return Begging markers once you have taken them.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Sub-phase 3: <b>The Breeding Phase</b>.</h5>\n\n<p>If you have at least 2 Farm animals of the same type, you get exactly 1 additional (baby) animal of that type - but only if the new animal can be accommodated on your Home board.</p>\n\n<p>Baby animals and parent animals may not be converted into Food immediately after the birth. You have to accommodate them on your Home board first.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game43.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>The player in this example has built a Stable in the Forest just outside his cave. Now he is able to keep up to 3 Wild boars.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, his Wild boars can breed a piglet (despite the fact that they currently do not seem to be interested in each other at all).</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>Details On Breeding</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You get all of your baby animals at the same time, not one by one.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You can only get at most one animal per type in each harvest.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Dogs are not considered Farm animals. They do not breed.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The animals breed regardless of where the parent animals are placed on your Home board. The parents may be in separate areas.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Which Rounds end with a Harvest?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Rounds 1 To 4</h5>\n\n<p>In the first four rounds, there is only one harvest: at the end of the third round. The first two rounds do not have a harvest at all. At the end of round 4, there is no harvest but instead you have to pay 1 Food per Dwarf in your cave (even for offspring Dwarfs). There is no Field or Breeding phase at this time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Rounds 5 To 12</h5>\n\n<p>By default there will be a harvest at the end of rounds 5 to 12.</p>\n\n<p>This may change if a Harvest marker shows a red question mark. (Harvest markers have been placed on Round spaces 6 to 12 during setup). The change depends on the number of question marks that have already been revealed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>As explained on the \"Harvest events\" card, there is no harvest at the end of the round in which the first question mark is revealed (like at the end of rounds 1 and 2).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>At the end of the round when the second question mark is revealed, instead of a harvest, you have to pay 1 Food per Dwarf in your cave (even for offspring Dwarfs; like at the end of round 4).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When the third question mark is revealed, you have to decide individually whether you want to play the Field phase or the Breeding phase of the Harvest time at the end of the round.<br><br>You cannot play both these phases, but you must still play the Feeding phase. Each player may choose differently.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To keep track of how many question marks have been already revealed, place them on the \"Harvest events\" card (from top to bottom) after they have been resolved.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>You will need a lot of Food for your hungry Dwarfs due to the high number of harvests in this game.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, you will collect crops more frequently and your animals will breed more often. If you take the right steps to feed your family early on, it will not be as hard as it seems.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this example, the first question mark has already been resolved. When the next one is revealed, all players will have to pay 1 Food for each of their Dwarfs.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game44.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Food Conversion Rules</h3>\n\n<p>To feed your Dwarfs, you may convert goods into Food at any time (without constraints). There is a Food conversion table at the bottom right of your Home board that summarizes the following Food conversion rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game45.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You can buy Food with Gold. Pay one more Gold than the amount of Food you wish to get. (For instance, 1/2/3/.. Food cost 2/3/4 Gold, respectively. Gold is available in denominations of 1, 2 and 10.</p>\n\n<p>You may change your Gold at any time. You cannot spend the Gold points that are awarded at the end of the game for things like Mines or Meadows. Keep in mind that each Gold is worth 1 point at the end of the game).</p>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, you can convert animals and crops into Food.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>Sheep are each worth 1 Food, Wild boars 2 Food, and Cattle 3 Food. A single Donkey is worth 1 Food, but 2 Donkeys are worth 3 Food.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Each Grain is worth 1 Food, and Vegetables are worth 2 Food.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Rubies could be exchanged for goods like Wild boars and Vegetables that are each worth 2 Food; therefore, you can convert Rubies into 2 Food directly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Dogs and the building materials Wood, Stone and Ore are not worth any Food. (Nor are Dwarfs, by the way).</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game46.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>The Food conversion table on your Home board summarizes the Food conversion rules.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>Now you know how to play a round. If you go back to pages 4 to 6, you might notice what we have not talked about yet: which actions you can take to become a wealthy dwarf. Let us have a look at the remaining rules by explaining the Action spaces.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As most of the following rules will be new to veteran 'Agricola' players as well, we will now stop using brown color to mark new stuff.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The Actions</h2>\n\n<p>Some Action spaces are already available at the beginning of the game, others will become available later. Some Action spaces are only available with a certain number of players.</p>\n\n<p>We will now explain the Action spaces grouped by type in the following order.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Action spaces for twin tiles</li>\n<li>Action spaces for family growth</li>\n<li>Action spaces for goods and mines</li>\n<li>Action spaces for animals</li>\n<li>Action spaces for weapons</li>\n<li>Starting player</li>\n<li>Imitation</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Check here <a href=\"actions.php\">all detailed information about the actions</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game119.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The game ends at the end of round 12. Use the scoring pad to determine the final scores. There are several different categories for which you can get Gold points. The player who has the most Gold points wins the game. (In case of a tie, there are multiple winners).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><b>1 Gold per Farm animal and Dog:</b> Each animal is worth 1 Gold point at the end of the game, even Dogs. (Dogs are not considered Farm animals).</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>-2 Gold per missing type of Farm animal:</b> At the end of the game, you should have at least 1 Sheep, 1 Donkey, 1 Wild boar and 1 Cattle. You lose 2 Gold points for each- of these types that you do not have on your Home board. (You do not need to have any Dogs).</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>1/2 Gold per Grain (rounded up):</b> Count all of your Grain tokens - both those in supply and those still left on Fields. Divide this number by 2 and round it up. This is the number of Gold points you get for Grain.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>1 Gold per Vegetable:</b> Count all of your Vegetable tokens - both those in your supply and those still left on Fields. You get this number of Gold points for Vegetables.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>1 Gold per Ruby:</b> At the end of the game, each Ruby is worth 1 Gold point.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>1 Gold per Dwarf:</b> At the end of the game, each of your Dwarfs is worth 1 Gold point.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>1 Gold per unused space:</b> Count the number of spaces on your Home board that have no tile or Stable on them. You lose 1 Gold point for each such space. The two pre-printed Caverns of your cave system are considered used. (Unfurnished Caverns are also considered used).</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Gold for Furnishing tiles, Pastures and Mines:</b> Add up the Gold point values on all of your tiles. Small pastures are worth 2 Gold points, Large pastures are worth 4 Gold points (regardless of the type and number of animals on those tiles).<br><br>Ore mines are worth 3 Gold points, Ruby mines are worth 4 Gold points (regardless of whether they hold a Donkey or not). The value of a Furnishing tile is printed on the right of the tile, right under the name of the tile.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Bonus points for Parlors, Storages and Chambers:</b> Most of the Furnishing tiles called Parlors, Storages and Chambers (indicated by the yellow name tag) may be worth Bonus points depending on the condition they impose.<br><br>The scoring pad has multiple lines for Bonus points. You can use one line per Furnishing tile that you get Bonus points for. (Details on the Furnishing tiles can be found on page A3 of the appendix).</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Gold coins and Begging markers:</b> Add up the values on your Gold coins and subtract 3 Gold points from that for each Begging marker you have.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>Details on Bonus Points</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>Bonus points for the Weaving parlor, Milking parlor, Fodder chamber, Food chamber and Treasure chamber are awarded as \"Bonus points\" (even though you could add them to other categories).</p>\n\n<p>Minus points prevented by the Writing chamber have to be adjusted in the respective categories.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game115.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>If you have the Weaving parlor, you will get points for Sheep twice: in the category \"1 Gold per Farm animal\" and in the category \"Bonus points for Parlors\".</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>As with the Writing chamber, Bonus points for the Hunting parlor, Beer parlor, Blacksmithing parlor and Spare part storage are not awarded as \"Bonus points\" on the scoring pad.</p>\n\n<p>These tiles allow you to exchange goods for Gold before scoring. (If you forgot to do so but notice it just before scoring, you may still do it).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/caverna/game116.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>If you have the Writing chamber, your minus points in the \"-2 Gold per missing type of Farm animal\", \"-1 Gold per unused space\" and \"Begging markers\" categories will be reduced.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"actions.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n</blockquote>",

Each turn, players play cards to gain Trade, Combat and other effects.</p>\n\n<p>Trade (<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/t.jpg\">) is used to buy more powerful cards to add to your deck.</p>\n\n<p>Combat (<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/c.jpg\">) is used to attack your opponent or their Bases directly.</p>\n\n<p>Authority (<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/a.jpg\">) is your score. Each player starts with a score of 50 Authority. If you reduce your opponent's Authority to zero, you win!</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Each player starts with a personal deck (containing 8 Scout cards and 2 Viper cards) and a score of 50 Authority. Leave space next to each personal deck for a discard pile. Place the 10 Explorer cards face up on the table.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the Trade Deck and place it face down on the table. Lay out 5 cards from the Trade Deck face up on the table. This is the Trade Row. Leave a space next to this for the Scrap Heap (a place to put cards that are removed from the game).</p>\n\n<p>Both players shuffle their personal decks. Randomly determine which player will play first. That player draws three cards (you always draw from your own personal deck), the other player draws five cards.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game1.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Players alternate taking turns. Each turn has three phases. These phases are played in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Main Phase</li>\n<li>Discard Phase</li>\n<li>Draw Phase</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2>1. Main Phase</h2>\n\n<p>During your Main Phase you may do any of the following, in any order you wish.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Play cards from your hand.</li>\n<li>Use abilities of Ships or Bases in play.</li>\n<li>Acquire Ships or Bases with Trade and place them in your discard pile.</li>\n<li>Attack your opponent or their bases with Combat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may repeat any of these as many times as you like. For example, you may play two cards from your hand, acquire a card, then play another card from your hand, etc.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Playing Cards</h3>\n\n<p>There is no cost to play a card, just place it in play (face up on the table in front of you) and do what it says. There are two types of cards you can have in your deck, Ships and Bases.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Ships</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Ships provide a one-time effect each time you play them. Ships you put into play stay in play (face up in front of you) until your Discard Phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Bases</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game3.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Bases stay in play turn after turn until they are destroyed or scrapped. Each Base has a Defense that represents the amount of Combat that it must be hit within a single turn to destroy it.</p>\n\n<p>Some Bases (designated \"Outpost\") protect you and your other Bases. If you have an Outpost in play, you may not be attacked and your non-outpost Bases may not be attacked or targeted by your opponent until all of your Outposts are destroyed.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Using Abilities</h3>\n\n<p>White in play, some Ships and most Bases have abilities that can be used at any time during your Main Phase.</p>\n\n<p>Primary Base Abilities</p>\n\n<p>Most Bases have an ability in their main text box. For example, Blob Wheel gives you 1 Combat. Some Bases have \"or\" between multiple abilities. You may choose Bases. one of these abilities to use each turn. For example with Barter World, you may choose to gain 2 Authority or 2 Trade, but not both.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Ally Abilites</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game4.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Some ships and bases have Ally Abilites. This is in addition to whatever else the card does. Ally Abilites are indicated by a faction icon in the text box.</p>\n\n<p>On your turn, an Ally Ability is triggered as soon as you have another Ship or Base of that faction in play. Once triggered, an Ally Ability may be used at any time during your Main Phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Scrap Abilities</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game5.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Some Ships and Bases have a Scrap Ability. This is in addition to whatever else the card does. Scrap Abilities are indicated by a trash can icon in the text box.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to use a cards Scrap Ability, remove the card from \"in play\" and place it in the Scrap Heap (the removed from the game pile). This card is no longer in your deck, so consider carefully if the ability is worth giving up that card forever! Scrapping a card in any other way does not give you the Scrap Ability.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> when an Explorer is scrapped in any way, it is placed face up in the Explorer Pile, not in the Scrap Heap.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game7.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Scrapping Cards</h3>\n\n<p>Some cards allow you to scrap other cards from your hand, your discard pile or the Center Row. When you scrap a card in this way, place it in the Scrap Heap. The Center Row always has 5 cards in it, so if you scrap a card from the Trade Row, immediately replace it with the next card from the Trade Deck.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game6.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Acquiring Cards</h3>\n\n<p>Some of the Ships and Bases you play will give you Trade. When you gain Trade it goes into a \"Trade Pool\" which you may add to and use over the course of your Main Phase. Trade is used to acquire cards from the Trade Row or the Explorer Pile.</p>\n\n<p>A card's cost is found in the Trade symbol in its upper right hand corner. To acquire a card, subtract Trade from your Trade Pool equal to the card's cost and then put the acquired card directly into your discard pile.</p>\n\n<p>Acquiring a card doesn't count as playing it, so it doesn't go into play and you don't use its abilities. Any remaining Trade is saved and can be used to acquire additional cards this turn. Sometimes a card's ability will instruct you to \"Acquire a card\".</p>\n\n<p>In this case you get to acquire the card without using Trade. Remember, the Trade Row always has 5 cards in it, so if you acquire a card from the Center Row, immediately replace it with the next card from the Trade Deck.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Attacking</h3>\n\n<p>Some of the Ships and Bases you play will give you Combat. When you gain Combat it goes into a \"Combat Pool\" which you may add to and use over the course of your Main Phase.</p>\n\n<p>You may use Combat to attack your opponent or their Bases. To attack a Base, subtract Combat from your Combat Pool equal to the Base's Defense. That Base is destroyed and goes to your opponent's discard pile.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes a card's ability will instruct you to \"Destroy target Base\". In this case, you destroy the Base without using Combat. To attack your opponent, subtract any amount of Combat from your Combat Pool, and lower your opponent's Authority by that amount.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/star-realms/game8.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>2. Discard Phase</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to a personal deck, each player has their own discard pile. When you discard or acquire cards, place them face up in your discard pile. Any player may look through your discard pile at any time.</p>\n\n<p>During your Discard Phase you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lose any Trade remaining in your Trade Pool.</li>\n<li>Lose any Combat remaining in your Combat Pool.</li>\n<li>Put all of your Ships that are \"in play\" into your discard pile.</li>\n<li>Put any cards left in your hand into your discard pile.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>3. Draw Phase</h2>\n\n<p>During your Draw Phase you: Draw 5 cards, then your turn ends.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> if you need to draw a card and your personal deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile and that becomes your new personal deck.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> At the beginning of your Draw Phase you have three cards left in your deck. Draw those three cards, shuffle your dis card pile into a new deck, then draw two more cards.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends when you are able to reduce your opponent's authority to zero and you are the winner.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"multiplayer-rules.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Play will proceed clockwise from there. The first player places 3 Clank! cubes in the Clank! Area. The second player places 2 Clank! The third and fourth players (if there are any) place 1 Clank! and 0 Clank!, respectively.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>CLANK! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose.</p>\n\n<p>Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box box_border\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/skill.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h4>Skill</h4>\n\n<p>Skill is used to acquire new cards for your deck.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/sword.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h4>Swords</h4>\n\n<p>Swords are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/boots.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h4>Boots</h4>\n\n<p>Boots which are used to move around the board.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck!</p>\n\n<p>Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they'll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player's deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Step 1: the Target</h3>\n\n<div class=\"box blue2_bg\">\n\n<p>The terms of this thieving challenge are clear: everyone must go into the dungeon and steal an Artifact. Escaping with your life is technically optional, although vastly preferable.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>During the game, you have two goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>You can normally carry only one Artifact, and once you've picked one up, you're stuck with it. Choose carefully!</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/artifact1.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>Artifact isn't worth many points, but at least it's easy to get to. Make sure to gather more loot to keep pace with your rivals!</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\"><br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/artifact2.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>Artifact is worth a lot more points, but the path to it is long and dangerous. Make sure you can escape the dungeon once you have it!</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Step 2: the Plan</h3>\n\n<div class=\"box blue2_bg\">\n\n<p>Stealing from the dragon is far from a simple job. You'll have to navigate through the ruins, deal with monsters, and acquire valuable treasures.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>During your turn, you can use the resources you've generated-Skill, Swords, and Boots-to take any of the following actions. You may take each action as many times as you like, as long as you have the resources to do so. You can wait and take your actions after you've played all of your cards, or you can take actions between cards if you wish.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Acquire a New Card for Your Deck.</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/corner.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You can use Skill to acquire cards with blue banners from the Dungeon Row (which change throughout the game) or cards with yellow banners from the Reserve (which are the same in every game).</p>\n\n<p>The Skill Cost of a card is found in its lower right corner. Once you pay the cost, place the card in your discard pile; it is now part of your deck.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Use a Device.</h4>\n\n<p>Devices are the cards with purple banners in the Dungeon Row.</p>\n\n<p>Devices can be acquired with Skill, but they do not become part of your deck. Instead, you perform the USE text listed on the card and then place it in the Dungeon discard pile (next to the Dungeon Deck).</p>\n\n<p>The Skill Cost of a Device is found in its lower right corner.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Fight a Monster</h4>\n\n<p>Monsters are the cards with red banners in the Dungeon Row. Instead of acquiring monsters with Skill, you fight them using Swords.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/swords.jpg\"> The Swords required to defeat a monster are found in its lower right corner.</p>\n\n<p>When you fight a monster in the Dungeon Row, you gain the reward listed in its DEFEAT text. Then the card is placed in the Dungeon discard pile (not your own discard pile).</p>\n\n<p>You may also fight the Goblin in the Reserve. It is not discarded when defeated; each player may fight it multiple times each turn, earning its reward each time.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Buy From the Market.</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/market.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The Market is a series of spaces where merchants serve those exploring the dungeon. If you are in a Market room, you may make a purchase.</p>\n\n<p>All items at the Market cost 7 Gold. Place each item you buy in front of you, in your play area. Items available at the Market are described on the back of the rule book.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Move Through a Tunnel.</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/boots.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Boots are how you traverse the passages of the dungeon. Each Boot lets you move along one tunnel to a new room.</p>\n\n<p>Some tunnels have special rules:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box box_border\">\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A tunnel with Footprint icons requires two Boots to traverse instead of one.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A tunnel with Monster icons deals that much damage to you when you move through it. For each Sword you use, you take one less damage (but you don't have to use Swords to move through a Monster tunnel).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You cannot use a tunnel with a lock icon unless you have a Master Key token (purchased from the Market) in your possession.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A tunnel shaped like an arrow can only be used in the direction of the arrow-you normally can't move through it in the opposite direction.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>When you move into a room, you can take one of the tokens there (Minor Secret, Major Secret, Monkey Idol, or Artifact) and put it in front of you.</p>\n\n<div class=\"box box_border\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>When you take an Artifact token, move the Dragon marker up one space along the Rage Track.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>You can only take one token when you move into a room. (If the room has more than one token in it, you must exit and re-enter to pick up another).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>You can't take an Artifact token if you already have one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>You don't have to take a token if you don't want to. (You might want to pass up one Artifact to go after a more valuable one elsewhere).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>When you take a Minor or Major Secret token, reveal it.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/crystalcave.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Whenever you enter a Crystal Cave room, you become exhausted while wandering its maze-like passages and cannot use any more Boots this turn. You may still be able to move by Teleporting (described in Advanced Maneuvers), but you won't be able to use Boots until your next turn.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>There are two other common effects that your cards many have:</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>I. Gaining Gold.</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When you gain Gold, take it from the Bank and put it in front of you. Each Gold is worth 1 point when the game ends, but you can also use it for other reasons during the game, such as buying items from the Market.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>II. Clank!</h4>\n\n<p>Some cards cause you to gain Clank! When this happens, add that many cubes from your personal supply to the Clank! Area of the game board. Some very sneaky cards cause you to remove Clank!</p>\n\n<p>For each negative Clank! you get, remove one of your Clank! from the Clank! Area. If you don't have enough Clank! there, you can instead avoid adding Clank! later in the turn if an effect would make you do so. Any leftover negative Clank! is lost when your turn ends.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've played all of your cards and used as much of your resources as you want to, your turn ends. Put all of the cards you played into your discard pile and draw five new cards in preparation for your next turn. Any Skill, Swords, or Boots you don't use are wasted, so make them count!</p>\n\n<div class=\"box gold_bg box_radius\">\n\n<p>The green player takes her turn by playing the following cards:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/cards.jpg\">\n\n<p>The green player carries out the text on her cards as soon as she plays them, adding 1 Clank! to the Clank! Area for her Stumble, and then removing it when she plays Move Silently.</p>\n\n<p>(She has another -1 Clank! left over from Move Silently, which she could use later in the turn if she were to make more Clank!) She has a total of two Boots, which she uses to move through two different tunnels. She ends up in a Crystal Cave room; she could not have moved farther this turn, even if she had more Boots.</p>\n\n<p>She uses her two Swords to Fight an Orc Grunt in the Dungeon Row. She gains 3 Gold ( from the Orc Grunt's Defeat text), and places the monster in the Dungeon discard pile.</p>\n\n<p>She uses her total 3 Skill to acquire a Kobold Merchant from the Dungeon Row, placing the card in her own discard pile. (She has just acquired the card; she won't get gold or skill from it until she reshuffles her discard pile, draws the card, and plays it).</p>\n\n<p>Having played all cards in her hand and used all the resources she can, the green player ends her turn.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Step 3: the Mark</h3>\n\n<div class=\"box blue2_bg\">\n\n<p>The queen of Dragon Keep is Nictotraxian-but we just call her \"Nicki\". She's not going to like us sneaking around her lair and taking her things.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/dragon.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>At the end of every turn, if any of the six spaces for cards in the Dungeon Row are empty, refill them with new cards from the Dungeon Deck. If any of the cards drawn have a Dragon Attack symbol, the dragon attacks! (But only once, no matter how many Dragon Attack symbols were revealed).</p>\n\n<p>To execute an attack, take all of the Clank! in the Clank! Area and put it in the Dragon Bag. Shake it up and draw a number of cubes from the bag equal to the number shown in the Dragon marker's current space of the Rage Track.</p>\n\n<p>Each black cube drawn is set aside, but each colored cube represents damage dealt to that player. (Undrawn cubes remain in the bag-they might still be drawn out later). The more Clank! you make, the more likely the dragon is to notice and attack you. Managing your noise level is key to survival!</p>\n\n<p>The dragon's rage increases throughout the game. Every time an Artifact is picked up, and whenever a Dragon Egg (a type of Minor Secret) is discovered, advance the Dragon marker one space along the Rage Track. This may cause more cubes to be drawn in the next attack. The more cubes being drawn, the deadlier the game becomes. Tread carefully!</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"box gold_bg box_radius\">\n\n<p>At the end of the yellow player's turn, there are only three cards left in the Dungeon Row. Three cards are revealed from the top of the Dungeon Deck to fill the empty spaces. Two of them have the Dragon Attack symbol, triggering an attack this turn.</p>\n\n<p>All the cubes in the Clank! Area are placed in the Dragon Bag. The Dragon marker is currently on the fifth space of the Rage Track, so four cubes are drawn from the bag.</p>\n\n<p>One cube is black; it is set aside, affecting no one. The second is green, so the green player takes 1 damage. The last two cubes are both yellow, so the yellow player takes 2 damage.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Step 4: the Getaway</h3>\n\n<div class=\"box blue2_bg\">\n\n<p>Dungeon delving is not without its risks. A master thief must carefully manage their physical state to maximize both profit and survivability. Remember, the two greatest obstacles to spending money are being broke and being dead.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Each player's health is tracked on a Health Meter at the bottom of the game board. When you take damage during the game-and you will take damage-place your cubes on the Health Meter of your color, starting from the left.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the damage came from a dragon attack, use the cubes that were pulled from the Dragon Bag.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you chose to take damage by moving through a Monster tunnel without a Sword, take the cubes from your personal supply. You can't choose to take damage this way if it would completely fill your Health Meter!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/heart.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Some effects can heal damage you've taken. When you heal, take back a cube of your color from your Health Meter and put it in your personal supply. You can use it again later for more Clank!</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/getaway2.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>If your Health Meter is ever completely filled, you are knocked out. What happens next depends on how successful you've been so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>If you have retrieved an Artifact and escaped the Depths area of the dungeon, you are rescued by the townsfolk and can count the points you've earned.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>If you haven't gotten an Artifact yet, or if you are still stuck in the Depths, then you can't be rescued. You lose the competition, which at this point is the least of your worries.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/artifact3.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Once you've picked up an Artifact, you can also make your way back to the place you started, outside of the dungeon. If you make it all the way back before being knocked out, you will receive a Mastery token worth an additional 20 points!</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Remember, if you don't have an Artifact yet, you can't leave the dungeon, or even be rescued!</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Step 5: the End of the Line</h3>\n\n<div class=\"box blue2_bg\">\n\n<p>Good timing is crucial in this heist-getting caught by a dragon is far worse than being pinched by the authorities! But as in all heists, there's nothing wrong with throwing your rivals under the proverbial carriage once you've made your escape.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Whenever a player leaves the dungeon or is knocked out, they no longer take normal turns. They add no more Clank! to the Clank! Area. Cards that affect all players don't affect them. If any cubes of their color are drawn from the Dragon Bag, no damage is dealt-they are treated like black cubes.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/endofline.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>In addition, the first time any player leaves the dungeon or is knocked out, that player moves their pawn to the first (leftmost) space of the Countdown Track near the entrance to the dungeon.</p>\n\n<p>On that player's next turn, instead of taking a normal turn, they move their pawn forward one space on the Countdown Track and execute that space's effects. (Other players who later leave the dungeon or get knocked out do not use the Countdown Track).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>On the second through fourth spaces, this causes an instant Dragon Attack. Additional cubes are drawn from the Dragon Bag for each of these attacks: 1 extra for the second space, 2 extra for the third, and 3 extra for the fourth.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>On the fifth space, the dragon instantly knocks out all players still in the dungeon.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>Once all players are out of the dungeon or knocked out, the game ends. All players who escaped the dungeon (or at least the Depths) add up their score, counting the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/artifact3.jpg\"> The value of their Artifact.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/othertokens.jpg\"> Points from any other tokens they acquired.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/5.jpg\"> Points equal to the amount of Gold they accumulated.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/clank/3.jpg\" class=\"floatl\"> Points awarded by cards in their deck. (The top right corner of each card shows the amount it's worth).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<p>The <b>player with the most points is the winner</b> and is declared the Greatest Thief in the Realm! In the case of a tie, the tied player with the most valuable Artifact is the winner.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"clank-in-space-rules.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Each player controls one, two, three, or four Survivors of a Zombie infection. The goal is simply to complete the Mission objectives and live to see another day.</p>\n\n<p>The good news: Zombies are slow, stupid, and predictable. The bad news: there are a lot of Zombies!</p>\n\n<p>Survivors use whatever they can get their hands on to kill Zombies. If they find bigger weapons, they can kill even more Zombies!</p>\n\n<p>You can trade equipment, give and receive (or ignore) advice, and even sacrifice yourself to save the girl! Only through co-operation, however, can you achieve the Mission objectives and survive. Killing Zombies is fun, but you will also need to rescue other Survivors, clean out infested areas, find food and weapons, take a ride through a ghost town, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>After experiencing Zombicide, your gaming group will be the ultimate zombie killing team in town!</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/components.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n<ul>\n<li>9 double-sided tiles</li>\n<li>6 survivor miniatures</li>\n<li>40 walker miniatures</li>\n<li>8 fatty miniatures</li>\n<li>16 runner miniatures</li>\n<li>1 abomination miniature</li>\n<li>42 zombie cards</li>\n<li>62 equipment cards</li>\n<li>6 wound cards</li>\n<li>6 dice</li>\n<li>6 character sheets</li>\n<li>10 Objective Tokens</li>\n<li>18 Noise Tokens</li>\n<li>12 Door Tokens</li>\n<li>1 First Player</li>\n<li>24 Skill Counters</li>\n<li>6 Experience Trackers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>Choose a Mission.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Place the tiles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Place the doors, the cars, and Objectives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Put aside the pimpmobile cards (Evil Twins and Ma's Shotgun), Molotov, Pan, and Wounded cards. Also keep a single Fire Axe, Crowbar, and Pistol card.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Shuffle the Zombie cards into one deck and the Equipment cards into another, then place them face down close to the board.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Each player chooses his Survivors based on the number of players:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 player:</b> 4 Survivors.</li>\n<li><b>2 players:</b> 3 Survivors per player.</li>\n<li><b>3 players:</b> 2 Survivors per player.</li>\n<li><b>4 to 6 players:</b> 1 Survivor per player.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Place the miniatures representing the chosen Survivors on the starting area as indicated by the Mission.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>On each Survivor's Identity Card, place an experience tracker on the first square in the blue area of the Danger Bar, and place a Skill counter on the first corresponding Skill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Randomly deal the starting equipment: a Fire Axe, Crowbar, Pistol, and enough Pans so that each Survivor gets one card. If a Survivor's starting Skill lists any starting weapons, he receives those cards now, independent of the starting Equipment that's just been distributed.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example:</b> Phil is dealt one of the random starting Equipment cards and gets the pistol! He then takes the weapon listed on his Identity Card from the Equipment deck: another pistol!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Decide who will be the first player, and give him or her the \"first player\" token. Zombicide is a cooperative game, so do not pick randomly!</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game85.jpg\"> Game Elements</h2>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Useful Definitions</h2>\n\n<h5>Actor</h5>\n\n<p>A Survivor or Zombie.</p>\n\n<h5>Zone</h5>\n\n<p>Inside a building, a Zone is a room. On the street, a Zone is the area between two pedestrian crossings and the walls of buildings along the street. A single Zone may extend over two tiles or even four tiles.</p>\n\n<h4>Line of Sight</h4>\n\n<p>How do I know if a Zombie sees me or if I see it?</p>\n\n<p>On the streets, Actors see in straight lines that run parallel to the edges of the board. Actors cannot see diagonally. Their line of sight covers as many Zones as the line can pass through before reaching a wall or the edge of the board.</p>\n\n<p>Inside a building, an Actor sees into all Zones that share an opening with the Zone the Actor currently occupies. If there is an opening, the walls do not block line of sight between two Zones. An Actor's line of sight, however, is limited to the distance of one Zone.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> If the Survivor is looking out into the street, or from the street into a building, the line of sight can go through any number of street Zones in a straight line, but only one Zone inside the building.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game1.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Movement</h4>\n\n<p>Actors can move from one Zone to the next, as long as the first Zone shares at least one edge with the destination Zone. Corners do not count; this means Actors cannot make diagonal movements.</p>\n\n<p>On streets, the movement from one Zone to another has no restrictions. However, Actors must go through a door to move from a building to the street and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>Inside a building, Actors may move from one Zone to another as long as these Zones are linked by an opening. The position of the miniature in the Zone and the layout of the walls do not matter, as long as the Zones share an opening.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game1_.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Noise</h4>\n\n<p>Firing a gun or smashing through a door makes noise, and noise attracts Zombies. Each Action that opens a door with a noisy weapon or attacks with a noisy weapon (see the \"Noisy Weapons\" callout) produces a Noise token.</p>\n\n<p>Place this token in the Zone where the Survivor resolved the Action. A single Action can only produce a single Noise token, no matter how many dice are rolled, how many hits are obtained, or if Dual weapons are used.</p>\n\n<p>Each Survivor miniature also counts as a Noise token. Yes, they just can't seem to stay quiet! Noise tokens are always removed from the board after the Zombies' Phase.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Ned opens a door with a Fire Axe. It's a noisy way to open a door. This produces a Noise token. He then attacks a Zombie in his Zone, knocking it down after a couple of whacks. The Fire Axe is a silent killing weapon, so this action produces no noise. There remain two \"noises\" in this Zone, however: the token produced by opening the door and Ned's miniature itself.</p>\n\n<p>In another Zone, Amy executes three Ranged Combat Actions with her two Dual Sub MGs. Although she rolled six dice, she gets only three Noise tokens in her Zone, one for each Ranged Action. The tokens remain on the square where she produced them; they don't follow Amy when she moves.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Noisy Weapons</h3>\n\n<p>Many Equipment cards, such as the Fire Axe, Crowbar, or Chainsaw, allow you to open doors as well as eliminate Zombies\".</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game2.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Equipment that allows you to open doors has this symbol.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game3.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Equipment that allows you to kill Zombies has this symbol.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<p>The association of these symbols with one of the following symbols determines whether the equipment produces a Noise token when you use it to open a door or eliminate a Zombie:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game4.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Equipment that has this symbol produces a Noise token.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game6.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Equipment which has this symbol is silent and does not produce a Noise token.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game7.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p><i>Example 1:</i> The Fire Axe can open doors and kill Zombies.</p>\n\n<p>It produces a Noise token when used to open a door.</p>\n\n<p>When you use it as Melee weapon to put down a Zombie, it does not produce a Noise token.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game8.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<p><i>Example 2:</i> The Chainsaw can also open doors and kill Zombies.</p>\n\n<p>It produces a Noise token when used to open a door AND when you use it as Melee weapon to make Zombie slices!</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game5.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Experience, Danger Level, And Skills</h4>\n\n<p>For each Zombie killed, a Survivor gains an experience point and moves up a notch on his Danger Bar. Some Mission objectives provide more experience, as does eliminating the Abomination.</p>\n\n<p>There are four Danger Levels: Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Red. These represent everything from a light drizzle of Zombies to a flash flood. (You really don't want to see what happens at the Red level..).</p>\n\n<p>On each Danger Level, the Survivor gains one new Skill to help him on his mission (see Skills, page 18). Skills add to each other across Danger Levels: at the Red Level, your Survivor will have four Skills.</p>\n\n<p>When a Survivor reaches 7 experience points, his Danger Level moves to Yellow, and he obtains a fourth Action. He may use this Action immediately and then every turn thereafter; in other words, he now has a permanent additional Action.</p>\n\n<p>When a Survivor gets 19 experience points, the Orange Danger Level becomes active, and he can choose one of the two Skills indicated on his Identity Card.</p>\n\n<p>At 43 experience points, the Survivor reaches the Red Danger Level and obtains one Skill from among the three available at this Level.</p>\n\n<p>This experience has a side effect, however. When you draw a Zombie card to spawn a Zone, read the line that corresponds to the Survivor with the highest Danger Level!</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game10.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Inventory</h4>\n\n<p>Each Survivor can carry up to five pieces of Equipment but can only have two equipped and ready to use (one in each hand) at any given time.</p>\n\n<p>While all weapons must be in a hand slot in order to use them (whether to attack or to open a door), other items, such as the Goalie Mask, Flashlight and Plenty of Ammo cards, are always in effect, even while in the reserve slots.</p>\n\n<p>If your Survivor has more than five Equipment cards, discard cards until he has five.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>The Zombies</h3>\n\n<p>There are four types of Zombies:</p>\n\n<h4>Walker</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game17.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>It stinks, it's nasty, and it's slow. Eliminating a Walker provides 1 experience point.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Fatty</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game12.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Big, bloated, and tough, these Zombies are hard to put down. Weapons dealing only 1 Damage can't hurt them...at all. Y</p>\n\n<p>ou need a 2 Damage weapon to kill them. Each Fatty spawns with two Walkers alongside him, except when its group is splitting (see Zombies' Phase, page 12). Killing a Fatty provides 1 experience point.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Abomination</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game11.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Mutated beyond recognition, the Abomination is the Survivors' worst nightmare. Only weapons dealing 3 Damage or more can kill this monster. A well-aimed Molotov will do the trick, as it</p>\n\n<p>kills everything in its target Zone. Luckily, there's only one Abomination on the board at any given time. If a second Abomination is drawn, replace it with a Fatty and its two Walkers.</p>\n\n<p>The Abomination spawns alone (possibly having eaten its Walker fellows). Killing an Abomination provides 5 experience points.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Runner</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/game18.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Amped up for some reason, these guys move twice as fast as Walkers. Each Runner has two Actions per activation, while all other Zombies only have one. Eliminating a Runner provides 1 experience point.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/zombicide/gameplay.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Zombicide is played over a series of game turns, which go as follows:</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>I. Players' Phase</h2>\n\n<p>The player with the \"first player\" token takes his turn, activating his Survivors one at a time, in the order of his choice. Each Survivor can initially perform three Actions per turn, though Skills may allow him to perform extra Actions as the game progresses.</p>\n\n<p>The Survivor uses his Actions to kill Zombies, move around the map, and perform other tasks to accomplish the various Mission objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Once a player has activated all his Survivors, the player to his left takes his turn, activating his Survivors in the same manner.</p>\n\n<p>When all the players have completed their turns, the Players' Phase ends.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"players-phase.php\">Players' Phase is explained in depth here</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>II. Zombies' Phase</h2>\n\n<p>All of the Zombies on the board activate and spend one Action either attacking a Survivor next to them or, if they have nobody to attack, moving toward the Survivors they see or, if they don't see any, toward the noisiest Zone.</p>\n\n<p>Runners get two Actions, so they can attack twice, attack and move, move and attack, or move twice.</p>\n\n<p>Once all Zombies have performed their Actions, new Zombies appear in all of the active Spawn Zones on the board.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"zombies-phase.php\">Zombies' Phase is explained in depth here</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>III. End Phase</h2>\n\n<p>All Noise tokens are removed from the board, and the first player hands the \"first player\" token to the player on his left. Another game turn then begins.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <b>game is lost</b> when all Survivors have been gruesomely killed and eliminated from the game.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The <b>game is won</b> immediately when all of the Mission objectives have been accomplished.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Zombicide is a cooperative game, so all players win if the Mission objectives are fulfilled, even if all of a player's Survivors have selflessly given their lives in heroic sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>A stupid death or willful suicide, on the other hand, can hardly be considered all that victorious.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"players-phase.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Prepare Playing Area</h4>\n\n<p>Unfold the board and place it in the center of the playing area. Make sure there is ample space around the edges of the board to place the investigator sheets and card decks. Place the various tokens and the dice near the board. Make sure to place the terror track marker on the \"0\" space on the terror track.</p>\n\n<h4>2. Place Initial Clues</h4>\n\n<p>Place one Clue token on each location on the board that has a red diamond above it. These locations are unstable and represent the places where dimensional gates can open and monsters can appear. Locations are identified by circular illustrations overlaying the Arkham portion of the game board (for example, Silver Twilight Lodge and Ma's Boarding House).</p>\n\n<h4>3. Choose First Player</h4>\n\n<p>Select one player at random to be the first player. Give the first player marker to that player.</p>\n\n<h4>4. Determ ine Investigators</h4>\n\n<p>The first player shuffles the 16 investigator sheets. Then, without looking, he randomly deals out one investigator sheet in front of each player, including himself. Alternately, the players may agree to choose their investigators, starting with the first player and continuing clockwise until every player has selected an investigator.</p>\n\n<h4>5. Reveal Ancient One</h4>\n\n<p>The first player shuffles the eight Ancient One sheets. Then, without looking, he selects one at random and places it face up near the board. This is the Ancient One that is threatening Arkham for this game. If the Ancient One's ability lists any actions that take place at the start of the game, such as Nyarlathotep's \"Thousand Masks\" ability, they are resolved now.</p> <p>Alternatively, the players may choose which Ancient One they face. This is often helpful if there are time constraints or other considerations involved. (Yig makes for a shorter game, for instance, while Cthulhu makes for a particularly challenging game).</p>\n\n<h4>6. Separate Decks</h4>\n\n<p>Separate the various investigator and Ancient One cards into their respective decks and place them near the board as shown in the setup diagram.</p>\n\n<h4>7. Receive Fixed Possessions</h4>\n\n<p>On each investigator sheet, certain items may be listed as fixed possessions. Each player, beginning with the first player and continuing clockwise, now receives the items listed on his investigator sheet in the \"Fixed Possessions\" area. The first player should locate the appropriate cards in the investigator decks and pass them out to the players, as noted on their investigator sheets.</p>\n\n<h4>8. Shuff le Investigator Decks</h4>\n\n<p>The players shuffle the Common Item, Unique Item, Spell, and Skill decks, then return them face down to their places next to the board. Whenever players draw cards, they draw them randomly from the tops of these decks.</p>\n\n<h4>9. Receive Random Possessions</h4>\n\n<p>Each investigator sheet may indicate that the investigator receives one or more random possessions. Each player, beginning with the first player and continuing clockwise, draws the indicated number of cards from the appropriate decks, as listed on his investigator sheet in the \"Random Possessions\" area.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Abilities that affect drawing cards from the card decks, such as Monterey Jack's Archaeology ability, do work when drawing random possessions at the start of the game.</p>\n\n<h4>10. Finish Investigator Setup</h4>\n\n<p>Each player now receives a number of Sanity tokens equal to his investigator's Sanity value and a number of Stamina tokens equal to his investigator's Stamina value. These values are listed on each investigator sheet. Each player should place these tokens near the appropriate area on his sheet.</p> <p>Each player also receives three skill sliders and places one skill slider on each of his three skill tracks. Each skill slider may be placed on any one of the four \"stops\" of each skill track.</p>\n\n<h4>11. Create Monster Cup</h4>\n\n<p>Place the monster markers in an opaque container and randomize them. A coffee cup, plastic container, or cloth bag works well for this purpose. Throughout these rules, we'll refer to this container as the monster cup. When a monster appears or otherwise enters play, the first player draws a monster marker randomly from the monster cup and places it on the game board as instructed in these rules or in the text of a specific card.</p> <p>Exception: Do not place the five \"Mask\" monsters in the container unless Nyarlathotep is the Ancient One. If any other Ancient One has been revealed, remove the Mask monsters from the game (simply return the markers to the box). Mask monsters are identified by the word \"Mask\" printed on the combat side of their markers.</p>\n\n<h4>12. Shuff le Ancient One Decks and Gate Markers</h4>\n\n<p>The players now shuffle the Gate and Mythos decks, and then return them to their places next to the board. Next, they shuffle the 16 Gate markers and place them face down in a stack next to the board.</p>\n\n<h4>13. Place Investigator Markers</h4>\n\n<p>Each player now takes the investigator marker depicting his investigator and places the marker on the game board location indicated on his investigator sheet in the \"Home\" area. The other investigator sheets and markers, as well as the unused Ancient One sheets, may now be removed from the game.</p>\n\n<h4>14. Draw and Resolve Mythos Card</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, the first player draws the top card of the Mythos deck and resolves it as described in the Mythos Phase section of the rules. If a Rumor is drawn, discard it and draw again until you draw a Mythos card that isn't a Rumor. The Mythos card will indicate an unstable location where a gate and monster appear. Remember, unstable locations are identified by red diamonds on the game board.</p>\n\n<p>Important: Remember to place a doom token on the Ancient One's doom track after the first gate opens. After the Mythos card has been completely resolved, the first turn begins, starting with the first player.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/box.png\" class=\"floatr margin-top-20\">\n\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>In Arkham Horror, a terrible creature from beyond time and space is waking, roused by the dimensional gates that are opening all over the city. The players must join forces to close all of the gates before this Ancient One awakens. If the Ancient One defeats the players, all of Arkham is doomed.</p>\n\n<p>The players must work together as a team of investigators to close all of the dimensional gates, seal them permanently, or if that fails, defeat the Ancient One when it awakens from its slumber.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>A turn in Arkham Horror is divided into five phases. During each phase, every player, starting with the first player and continuing clockwise, performs the actions that take place during that phase. Once all players have completed a phase, the next phase begins. At the end of the last phase in each turn, the first player marker is passed to the player on the left and a new turn begins. The phases of each turn are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Phase I: Upkeep</li>\n<li>Phase II: Movement</li>\n<li>Phase III: Arkham Encounters</li>\n<li>Phase IV: Other World Encounters</li>\n<li>Phase V: Mythos</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase I: Upkeep</h2>\n\n<p>During the Upkeep Phase, each player takes the following actions, in order.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Refresh Exhausted Cards</h3>\n\n<p>Some cards exhaust themselves when used, which means that they are turned face down for the remainder of the turn. At the start of the Upkeep Phase, each player refreshes those cards by turning them face up. Simply remember that you can use face-up cards and that you cannot use face-down cards until you turn them face up again during the next Upkeep Phase.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Richard (playing Harvey Walters) cast his Wither spell last turn, forcing him to exhaust the card by turning it face down. During the Upkeep Phase, Richard turns the Wither spell face up once more. The spell is now ready for him to cast again.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Perform Upkeep Actions</h3>\n\n<p>After refreshing his exhausted cards, each player must review his investigator's cards to see if any of them have an Upkeep action. Each player must perform all Upkeep actions listed on his investigator's cards every turn.</p>\n\n<p>Upkeep actions may be taken in any order the player wishes. Bless, Curse, Bank Loan, and Retainer cards do not require an upkeep roll during the first Upkeep Phase after an investigator acquires them.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Looking over his cards, Richard finds that he has a Retainer card, which requires an Upkeep action. First, Richard receives $2 for the Retainer. He takes two money tokens from the pile of money tokens in the play area. Richard must then roll a die to see if he keeps or loses the Retainer. Richard is fortunate and keeps the Retainer card for another turn.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/adjusting-skills.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>3. Adjust Skills</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, each player may adjust his investigator's skills using the three skill sliders he placed on his investigator sheet during game setup. This process, as well as a general description of how skill sliders work, is explained in the \"Adjusting Skills\" diagram.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: During game setup, players may set their three skill sliders on any of the four stops on their three skill tracks. This initial setup does not adhere to the normal rules that restrict the number of stops a slider may be moved each turn.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase II: Movement</h2>\n\n<p>During the Movement Phase, each player takes one of the following two movement actions, depending on whether his investigator is in Arkham or an Other World: Arkham movement or Other Worlds movement.</p>\n\n<p>The two types of investigator movement are described below.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/arkham-movement.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h3>Arkham Movement</h3>\n\n<p>If the player's investigator is located in Arkham (i.e., his investigator marker is in the town area of the game board), he receives movement points equal to his Speed value, as found on his investigator sheet.</p> <p>A player may spend one movement point to move his investigator marker from one board area to another, so long as the two areas are connected by a yellow line on the game board. One movement point allows an investigator to move from a location to a street area, from one street area to another, or from a street area to a location.</p>\n\n<p>Locations are indicated by circular illustrations on the Arkham portion of the game board. Street areas are represented by rectangular boxes on the game board, one for each neighborhood in Arkham (for example, Miskatonic U. and Rivertown).</p>\n\n<h3>Evading Monsters</h3>\n\n<p>Locations and street areas that contain monster markers may affect an investigator's movement. Each time an investigator attempts to leave a location or street area occupied by one or more monster markers, the investigator must either fight or evade each of the monsters there. Likewise, if an investigator ends his movement in a location or street area occupied by one or more monsters, he must fight or evade each such monster.</p>\n\n<p>If the investigator fails to evade a monster, the monster immediately deals its combat damage to him and he immediately enters combat with it.</p>\n\n<p>Once an investigator begins combat with a monster for any reason, his movement is over. Regardless of whether or not he wins the battle, the investigator loses the rest of his movement points and must remain where he is.</p>\n\n<h3>Picking Up Clues</h3>\n\n<p>Any time an investigator ends his movement in a location that contains Clue tokens, he may immediately take any or all of those Clue tokens. The investigator may not take any Clue tokens if he merely moves through the location and then continues his movement: He must end his movement in the location containing the Clue tokens.</p>\n\n<h3>Other World Movement</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/other-world-movement.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Other Worlds are represented by the large circular spaces along the edge of the game board. These spaces represent bizarre locales, strange dimensions, and alternate worlds that figure prominently in the Mythos. Players typically enter these worlds by exploring gates.</p>\n\n<p>Note that each circular space representing an Other World is bisected by a prominent line: The areas to the left and right of this line are the two areas of the Other World.</p>\n\n<p>If an investigator is in an Other World at the beginning of the Movement Phase, he receives no movement points. Instead, his movement depends on whether he is in the first (left) or second (right) area of the Other World.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>If the investigator is in the first area of the Other World, he moves to the second area.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the investigator is in the second area of the Other World, he returns to Arkham. The player must choose a location that contains a gate to the Other World he is leaving. After choosing such a location, he places his investigator marker there. Then he places an \"explored\" marker underneath his investigator to show that he has explored the gate. This marker remains in play as long as the investigator remains at the location. If there is no open gate leading to the Other World the investigator is in, the investigator is lost in time and space.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Delayed Investigators</h3>\n\n<p>During the game, certain effects can cause an investigator to become delayed. When this occurs, place the investigator marker on its side, indicating the delay.</p>\n\n<p>Delayed investigators receive no movement points and do not move during the Movement Phase. Instead, during the investigator's Movement Phase, the player stands the investigator marker back up to show that the investigator is no longer delayed. On the following turn, the investigator will be able to move once again as normal.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase III: Arkham Encounters</h2>\n\n<p>During the Arkham Encounters Phase, each player whose investigator is in a location (not a street area or Other World area) must take one of the following actions. The action the investigator must take depends on whether his location contains an open gate or not.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/no-gate.jpg\" class=\"floatr margin-top-10\">\n\n<h3>1. No Gate</h3>\n\n<p>If the location has no gate, the investigator has an encounter at the location. The player shuffles the location deck corresponding to the neighborhood his investigator is in and draws a card from the deck. The player then finds the entry for his investigator's location, reads the entry aloud, and performs any actions indicated by the card text. Note that the card may indicate that \"a monster appears\", in which case the investigator must either evade the monster or fight it. Once the player has resolved any actions indicated by the card, he returns the card to the location deck.</p>\n\n<p>Monsters and gates cannot appear in sealed locations, even if this is directed by the text of a card.</p>\n\n<p>Monsters that appear as the result of a location or gate encounter never remain on the board after the encounter is resolved. If an investigator evades such a monster, return it to the monster cup.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Gate</h3>\n\n<p>If the location has a gate, the investigator is drawn through the gate. He moves to the first area (the left area) of the Other World indicated on the gate marker.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: Once an investigator has entered a gate and returned to Arkham, the player places an explored marker underneath his investigator marker. While he remains in the gate's location, he is no longer drawn through the gate, but may instead try to close or seal the gate. If the investigator leaves the location before the gate is closed or sealed, discard the explored marker.</p>\n\n<p>If the investigator returns to the location later in the game, he will again be drawn through the gate. He must resolve the Other World Encounters Phase again before he can return to the location and attempt to close or seal the gate.</p>\n\n<p>Important: If an investigator is drawn through a gate that appears as a result of an encounter (such as \"A gate appears!\" or \"A gate and a monster appear!\"), then he is delayed, just as if he had been drawn through a gate in the Mythos Phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase IV: Other World Encounters</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/other-world.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>During the Other World Encounters Phase, investigators in Other World spaces have encounters there. The Other World spaces on the board are marked with circular icons of different colors.</p>\n\n<p>These colored circles are called encounter symbols. When an investigator has an Other World encounter, the player draws cards from the gate deck, one at a time, until he draws a card whose color matches one of these encounter symbols. Gate cards that do not match a color of the encounter symbols are placed face down on the bottom of the gate deck.</p>\n\n<p>Once the player has drawn a gate card that matches an encounter symbol's color, he examines it to see if there is a specific encounter for the Other World his investigator is currently in.</p>\n\n<p>If a specific encounter is listed, the player reads that entry aloud and performs any actions indicated by the card text. If there is no specific encounter listed, the player reads the \"Other\" entry aloud and performs any actions indicated by the card text.</p>\n\n<p>The card text of an Other World encounter may result in a monster appearing, in which case the investigator must either evade the monster or fight it. Once the encounter is resolved, the player then discards the card face down to the bottom of the gate deck.</p>\n\n<p>Monsters that appear as the result of location or gate encounters never remain on the board after the encounter is resolved. If an investigator evades such a monster, return it to the monster cup.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase V: Mythos</h2>\n\n<p>During the Mythos Phase, the first player draws a Mythos card and performs the following actions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Gate and Spawn Monster</li>\n<li>Place Clue Token</li>\n<li>Move Monsters</li>\n<li>Activate Mythos Ability</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Each of these actions is performed as follows.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Open Gate and Spawn Monster</h3>\n\n<p>The first player begins by looking at the lower-left corner of the Mythos card he has drawn to see where the dimensional forces are assaulting Arkham this turn. One of three things happens, depending on whether there is an open gate, an elder sign marker, or neither at that location.</p>\n\n<h4>A. Location Has Elder Sign</h4>\n\n<p>If an elder sign token has been placed at the location, nothing happens. No gate opens and no monster appears. The elder sign has permanently sealed the gate at this location, and no new gates can open here.</p>\n\n<h4>B. Location Has Open Gate</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/resolving-mythos-card.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If there is already an open gate at the location, a monster emerges from every open gate currently on the board. This is called a monster surge. When a monster surge occurs, the number of monsters drawn and placed is equal to the number of open gates or the number of players, whichever is greater. The first player draws monster markers from the cup at random and places them on each location with an open gate. When placing monsters, they should be divided as evenly as possible among the open gates, with no gate having more monsters placed on it than the gate where the monster surge occurred this turn.</p> <p>If there are more monsters to be placed than allowed by the monster limit, the players should decide where monsters will be placed. The players must make this decision before monsters have been drawn from the cup. If the players cannot agree where the monsters are to be placed, the first player decides the placement.</p>\n\n<p>Example: There are 3 open gates (at the Black Cave, Science Building, and Unvisited Isle), 7 players, and no monsters in play when a Mythos card is drawn that opens a gate at the Black Cave.</p>\n\n<p>This causes a monster surge: 7 monsters are drawn from the cup and placed on the open gates. They must be distributed as evenly as possible, so each of the 3 gates gets 2 monsters placed on it, and the 7th monster is placed on the Black Cave, where the monster surge occurred. The Black Cave now has 3 monsters, while the other 2 open gates each have 2 monsters on them.</p>\n\n<h4>C. No Elder Sign or Gate</h4>\n\n<p>If there is neither an open gate nor an elder sign marker at the location, a new gate opens and a monster emerges from it. This means that the following things happen, in order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>The Doom Track Advances</b></p>\n\n<p>The first player places a doom token with the eye symbol face up in the first available space on the Ancient One's doom track. If the marker is placed in the last available space on the doom track, the Ancient One has awakened and the end of the game has begun. If the Ancient One awakens, you do not need to complete the rest of the Mythos Phase: Proceed immediately to the final battle.</p>\n\n<p>Note that it is also possible for the Ancient One to awaken because there are too many gates open in Arkham at once.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>A Gate Opens</b></p>\n\n<p>The first player draws a gate marker from the stack of gate markers near the board and places it face up on the location. Discard any Clue tokens that were on the location: The investigators have missed their opportunity to follow up on those leads.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><b>A Monster Appears</b></p>\n\n<p>The first player draws a monster marker from the cup at random and places it on the location. If this would bring player places the monster in the Outskirts instead.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: If there are five or more investigators playing, then draw and place two monsters instead of one.</p>\n\n<p>Important: Unlike investigators, monsters are never drawn through gates.</p>\n\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Gates Opening On Investigators</h4>\n\n<p>If a gate opens at a location that contains an investigator, he is immediately drawn through the gate to the first area of the corresponding Other World. As a result of the sudden disorientation caused by the gate swallowing him, the investigator is delayed. Place his investigator marker on its side. The investigator will not move during the next Movement Phase.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Place Clue Token</h3>\n\n<p>Most Mythos cards indicate a location where a Clue token appears. Place a Clue token on the indicated location unless there is an open gate there. If one or more investigators are at that location, one of them (they should decide among themselves) may immediately take that Clue token. If the players cannot agree on who gets the Clue token, the first player decides.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Move Monsters</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/monster-movement.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Although monsters start out in locations as they emerge from gates, they soon leave those locations to roam the streets of Arkham.</p>\n\n<p>In order to determine monster movement, the first player looks at the lower-right corner of the Mythos card he has drawn for the turn. This area describes which monsters move during the turn as well as the direction they move on the board.</p>\n\n<p>Each Mythos card has two movement areas on it, represented by black and white boxes. Each location and street area on the board likewise features a black or white arrow.</p>\n\n<p>Each movement box on a Mythos card also has one or more dimension symbols printed in it. Each monster marker likewise features such a dimension symbol on its movement side.</p>\n\n<p>Monsters currently on the board whose dimension symbols are listed in either movement box on the Mythos card move to a connected location or street area, as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>If the monster is listed in the white movement box, it follows the white arrow leading out of its current area.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the monster is listed in the black movement box, it follows the black arrow leading out of its current area.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Important: The arrows leading out of some locations are black on one side and white on the other. These arrows count as both a black arrow and a white arrow, so monsters listed in either the black or the white movement box of the Mythos card follow that arrow.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/monster-movement2.jpg\"><br>\n\n<h4>Monster Movement and Investigators</h4>\n\n<p>A monster that already shares a location or street area with one or more investigators does not move and remains in place. Certain monsters move several times (see the description of \"Fast\" monsters below); when such a monster enters an area that contains one or more investigators, it must immediately stop moving. No encounter with the monster takes place during this phase, but the investigators will be forced to evade or fight the monster during the Movement Phase.</p>\n\n<p>Example: A Star Spawn moves into Uptown, where Joe Diamond and Ashcan Pete are currently located. During their next Movement Phase, one or possibly both of these investigators will need to deal with the Star Spawn.</p>\n\n<h4>Monster Movement Specialties</h4>\n\n<p>Most monsters move as described above, but some monsters have special movement abilities that follow special rules. There are five different types of monster movement in Arkham Horror.</p>\n\n<p>These are indicated by the colored borders on the movement side of the monster markers:</p>\n\n<p><b>Normal (Black Border)</b>: Normal monsters move as described above.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stationary (Yellow Border)</b>: Stationary monsters never move. They always remain at the location where they entered play.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fast (Red Border)</b>: Fast monsters move twice, following the appropriate arrows for both steps of their movement. Fast monsters stop moving immediately if they encounter an investigator.</p>\n\n<p>Unique (Green Border): Monsters with unique movement (such as the Hound of Tindalos) have special movement abilities listed on the combat side of their monster markers. Turn such a monster marker over and follow the instructions there.</p> <p><b>Flying (Blue Border)</b>: Flying monsters generally move directly towards the nearest investigator in a street area, or move to the \"Sky\" holding area if they can't reach any investigators this turn.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/flying-monsters.jpg\"><br>\n\n<h3>4. Activate Mythos Ability</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, the first player looks at the special text on the Mythos card, examining the trait listed at the top of the card. The various traits indicate different types of Mythos cards.</p>\n\n<p><b>Headline:</b> The first player immediately resolves the special text of a Headline Mythos card. He then discards the Mythos card face down to the bottom of the Mythos deck.</p>\n\n<p><b>Environment:</b> The special text of an Environment Mythos card remains in play for several turns, possibly even until the end of the game. The first player places the card face up next to the game board, discarding any previous Environment Mythos card face down to the bottom of the Mythos deck. This means that only one Environment Mythos card can be in play at a time.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rumor:</b> The special text of a Rumor Mythos card remains in effect until either the Pass or Fail condition on the card is met, at which point the card is resolved and is discarded face down to the bottom of the Mythos deck.</p>\n\n<p>Only one Rumor can be in play at once. If there is already a Rumor Mythos card in play, ignore the special text of the newly drawn Rumor and discard it face down to the bottom of the Mythos deck after resolving its other effects for the turn (such as gate opening and monster movement).\n\n</p><p><b>Other Effects:</b> Additionally, the Mythos card may call for one or more \"activity\" or \"closed\" markers to be placed on specific locations. Simply place the respective markers on the locations indicated by the card. If the card leaves play, remove the markers from the locations as well.</p>\n\n<h3>Turn End</h3>\n\n<p>Once the first player has resolved all steps of the Mythos Phase, the first player marker is passed to the left. The turn is now over and a new one begins with the Upkeep Phase.</p>\n\n<p>Play continues in this way until the end of the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/game-end.jpg\" class=\"floatr margin-top-20\">\n\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends in one of two ways: The investigators either overcome the Mythos threat, or they are defeated by it.</p>\n\n<h3>Victory</h3>\n\n<p>The investigators win the game in any of the following three ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><h4>A. Close the Gates</h4>\n\n<p>To satisfy this victory condition, the players must accomplish two objectives:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An investigator must close the last gate on the board, such that there are currently no open gates.</li>\n<li>When the last gate is closed, the players must have a number of gate trophies equal to or greater than the number of players. These gate trophies do include the one just awarded for closing the last gate, but do not include any trophies the players have spent.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>If these two conditions are met, the players immediately win. Stability is restored to Arkham as the Ancient One slips back into a deep slumber for a few more millennia.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>B. Seal the Gates</h4>\n\n<p>If, at any time, there are six or more elder sign tokens on the board, the players immediately win. The Ancient One is driven away and peace returns to Arkham.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>C. Banish the Ancient One</h4>\n\n<p>If the Ancient One awakens but the investigators manage to defeat it, the players immediately win. The Ancient One is banished beyond time and space.</p>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Scoring Victories</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/arkham-horror/game-end2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If the players achieve one of the preceding victory conditions, the investigators have defeated the Mythos threat and saved Arkham. The player with the most gate trophies is awarded the honorary title of First Citizen of Arkham. In the case of a tie, the title goes to the player with the most monster trophies.</p>\n\n<p>You can rate your victory by using the following scoring system. Start with the highest printed number on the doom track of the Ancient One. Subtract the terror level at the end of the game from this number. Now apply the following modifiers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>-1 per unpaid/defaulted Bank Loan</li>\n<li>-1 per elder sign played during the game</li>\n<li>+1 per unspent gate trophy at the end of the game</li>\n<li>+1 for every three unspent monster trophies held at the end of the game.</li>\n<li>+1 per sane, surviving investigator at the end of the game.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Defeat</h3>\n\n<p>If the Ancient One awakens and defeats all of the investigators in battle, the space-time continuum ruptures, the Ancient One is unleashed, and all of mankind suffers for the investigators' failure. In this unfortunate event, all players lose the game.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"skills.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

The players place their people on the game board</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/people.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The start player begins and must place 1 or more of his people on one place of his choice.</p>\n\n<p>Then the next player in clockwise order follows and must also place 1 or more of his people on one place of his choice. This continues in clockwise order until all players have placed all their people on the game board.</p>\n\n<p>The number of rings in a place indicates how many people can be there before it is full.</p>\n\n<p>Passing is not permitted, if there are still places available for people. Placing again is not permitted.</p>\n\n<p>How many people can be placed at the individual places?</p>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow_bg\">\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Tool maker</b> - 1</li>\n<li><b>Hut</b> - 2</li>\n<li><b>Field</b> - 1</li>\n<li><b>Hunt</b> - unlimited</li>\n<li><b>Resource spaces</b> - up to 7 people</li>\n<li><b>Buildings</b> - 1</li>\n<li><b>Civilization cards</b> - 1</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Since the individual places accept different numbers of people figures, it often occurs that one or more players will have no more people figures to place while others still have people figures they can place.</p>\n\n<p>If no player can place people figures (because each has already placed all his figures or each has no legal places to place the figures he has), the 2nd phase begins.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>II. The players use the actions of their placed people</h2>\n\n<p>The start player begins. He uses all his placed people figures. Only then does the next player, in clockwise order, use his people. The order a player chooses to use his people is completely up to him.</p>\n\n<p>The player returns people use to his player board as he uses them. In this way, the player has all his people back when he is done.</p>\n\n<p>Which actions can the player use on the individual places?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Tool Maker</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/toolmaker.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Here the player takes 1 new tool. If he has no tools, then he takes a value 1 tool and places it with the number 1 showing on one of the spaces for tool on his player board.</p>\n\n<p>Each tool tools can be used only once per round to roll a die with the hunt or during resource procurement. A tool can be only completely used. Thus, it can split and used later for a different action.</p>\n\n<p>A player can add as many of his tools to a dice roll. In order to show that a tool was used, the player turns it around by 90°.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Hut</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/hut.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Here the player takes 1 additional people figure of his color from the general supply. He has thereby for all following rounds one more people figure available.</p>\n\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Field</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/field.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The player returns his people figure to his player board and moves his marker on the food track 1 space upward. Thus, he increases his food production, which he receives at the end of each round.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Hunt</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/hunt.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The player takes 1 die for each of his people figures on the hunt and rolls them all together. He adds all the pips on the dice.</p>\n\n<p>Then he can add as many of his tools to the total from the roll. For each full 2 of the thrown total, he takes 1 food from the game board.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Forest, Clay Pit, Quarry, and River</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/resourcefields.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>At these 4 places, the players take wood, brick, stone, and gold.</p>\n\n<p>The procurement of these resources works in the same way as the hunt, except that the yields are different:</p>\n\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Forest - for each full 3, the player takes 1 wood from the supply.</li>\n<li>Clay pit - for each full 4, the player takes 1 brick from the supply.</li>\n<li>Quarry - for each full 5, the player takes 1 stone from the supply.</li>\n<li>River - for each full 6, the player takes 1 gold from the supply.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Civilization Cards</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/civcards.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The player pays the number of resurces shown above the card to the supply from his player board and takes the card</p>\n\n<p>Which resources the player pays (from wood, brick, stone, and/or gold) is up to him and what he has: usually it will be wood and/or brick, but he can never use food.</p>\n\n<p>If the player cannot or does not want to pay the required resources, he takes back his people figure and leaves the card on the game board.</p>\n\n<p>Each player stacks his acquired civilization cards face down on the designated space on his player board.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Buildings</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/buildings.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The player pays the resources shown on the building to the supply from his player board and takes the building.</p>\n\n<p>Then the player immediately moves his scoring marker on the scoring track by the number of spaces shown on the building. Afterwards, he turns over the next building on this stack.</p>\n\n<p>There are 8 buildings where the player can choose which resources to pay with, but the number is fixed. And there are 3 buildings, where the player can choose both the kind and number of resources to pay with (maximum 7).</p>\n\n<p>When a player takes one of these buildings, he must calculate the number of spaces (= points) he moves on the scoring track.</p>\n\n<p>The player places the acquired building on one of the spaces for buildings on his player board. If a player acquires more than 5 buildings, he stacks them on these spaces.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>III. the Players Feed Their People</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/stone-age/foodcoins.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When all players have taken all their people figures back to their player board, they must feed their people. Each people figure requires 1 food.</p>\n\n<p>First, each player takes food from the supply according to the postion of his marker on the food track. Then each player returns 1 food to the supply for each people figure on his player board.</p>\n\n<p>If a player does not have sufficient food to feed his people, then: He must place all food that he has back into the supply.</p>\n\n<p>Then, he may, if he wants to (and can), pay the remainder in the form of any resources into the supply. Each resource replaces 1 food. Thus, his people are also content as they were able exchange the resources for food).</p>\n\n<p>If the player cannot or does not want to do this, he immediately moves his scoring marker backwards 10 points on the scoring track.</p>\n\n<p>In such case, the player must return all food he has to the supply. When all players have fed their people (or not and lost 10 points), the round ends. The start player gives the start player marker to his left neighbor and the next round begins.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends in one of two ways:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow5_border yellow_bg\">\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If there are not enough civilization cards remaining to fill the display at the beginning of the round, the game ends immediately. In this case, no new round is begun.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If at least 1 building stack is empty.

It shows the village with its various areas.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/setup.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>A) grain harvest<br>\n\n</p><p>B) family<br> C) crafts<br> D) market<br> E) travel<br> F) council chamber<br> G) church<br> H) well<br> I) village chronicle<br> J) anonymous graves</p>\n\n<p>Each player chooses a color. Take the farmyard of your color and place it in front of you. Your farmyard is home to your family members. In addition, you may store as many influence cubes and goods here as you want. Each farmyard can only store a maximum of 5 bags of grain, however. The life time track of your family runs around the edge of your farmyard.</p>\n\n<p>Take the 11 family members and 8 markers of your chosen color. Put your 4 family members with a \"1\" on your farmyard. This is the first generation of your family. The remaining family members are future generations. Since these are not born yet, set them aside in a general supply for now.</p>\n\n<p>Put one of your markers on the cloud on the right side of the bridge on your farmyard. Put another marker on the book (space \"0\" of the prestige track) in the upper left corner of the game board.</p>\n\n<p>Give each player 1 coin, which he places next to his farmyard. Place the remaining coins in a general supply next to the game board.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the customer tiles face down and put them next to the market as a face down pile. Depending on the number of players, turn a certain number of tiles face up and add them to the market:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>in a 4-player-game: put a tile on each of the 10 spaces.</li>\n<li>in a 3-player-game: the space labeled \"4\" remains empty.</li>\n<li>in a 2-player-game: the spaces labeled \"3\" and \"4\" remain empty Example for a 3-player-game.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you play with fewer than 4 players, use family members of an unclaimed color to reduce the number of available spaces in the chronicle and the anonymous graves.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>in a 3-player-game: put an unused family member on each space and grave labeled \"4\".</li>\n<li>in a 2-player-game: put an unused family member on each space and grave labeled \"3\" or \"4\".</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/nextplayer.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Put the next starting player marker on its designated space of the council chamber. Place the goods tiles (horses, oxen, wagons, plows, and scrolls) next to the game board as a general supply.</p>\n\n<p>Place the bags of grain, the influence cubes, and the plague cubes next to the game board as a general supply. Also place the green bag nearby. Put the 4 black monks in the black bag and place it below the church.</p>\n\n<p>Take the setup card that matches the number of players and place it nearby. Return the remaining two setup cards to the box. Also place the \"mass\" overview card near the game board. The oldest player becomes the starting player and receives the starting player marker.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>You must gain the most prestige points and the game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graves are fully occupied. At that point you once more gain points for the different areas of the village.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/gameplay.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The game is played over several rounds, during which you control the fate of your family members by placing them wisely in the village. Family members on your farmyard ensure a good harvest, in church they generate prestige points, and in the council chamber they give you both prestige points and privileges. Those who opt for traveling may receive prestige, influence, or money, depending on their destination. Family members in the craft buildings enable the production of goods. Goods and grain can be exchanged for prestige points at the market.</p>\n\n<p>The many different areas in the village allow for many different options. Each area has an associated action space where you can gain different types of influence cubes and trigger certain actions.</p>\n\n<p>That means you have to choose wisely, because the influence type and specific action rarely match...</p>\n\n<p>In addition, many of these actions cost time. And just like in real life, the oldest family members eventually pass away. When a family member dies, his career choice determines whether he gets a place in the village chronicle or not.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of each round, seed the action spaces with influence cubes and plague cubes. Then, beginning with the starting player, players take turns carrying out actions.</p>\n\n<p>On your turn, take one cube from an action space and perform that space's action. When the last cube is taken, the current round is finished. Begin a new round by once again filling the green bag and seeding the action spaces.</p>\n\n<h4>Influence cubes and plague cubes</h4>\n\n<p>Influence cubes are required for performing certain actions in the village. The following types of influence are available:</p>\n\n<table class=\"table border\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr><th width=\"150\">Color:</th><th>Represents:</th><th>Is required for:</th></tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/orange.jpg\"> Orange</td><td>skill</td><td>crafts, travel</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/green.jpg\"> green</td><td>persuasiveness</td><td>market, council chamber</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/brown.jpg\"> brown</td><td>faith</td><td>church, travel</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/pink.jpg\"> pink</td><td>knowledge</td><td>crafts, travel</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/black.jpg\"> black</td><td colspan=\"2\">The black cubes are not a type of influence. They are plague cubes that reduce the life span of your family members.</td></tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table><br>\n\n<h4>Seeding the action spaces</h4>\n\n<p>The setup card shows how many different influence cubes you must take from the supply and add to the green bag at the beginning of a round. In addition, you must add all available plague cubes to the bag.</p>\n\n<p>Once the cubes are in the bag, mix them thoroughly. Then distribute a certain number of randomly drawn cubes onto each action space on the game board. The number of cubes per action space is also shown on the setup card.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/seedingactionspaces.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Note: If there are fewer influence cubes of one color available in the supply than the number you are supposed to add to the bag, then add only the available cubes. (Since some cubes remain in the bag each round, you will still be able to fully seed the action spaces). The starting player then takes his turn.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Taking your turn</h2>\n\n<p>On your turn, you must take one influence or plague cube from an action space of your choice. If it is an influence cube, put it on your farmyard. (You may store any number of influence cubes on your farmyard).</p>\n\n<p>If it is a plague cube, immediately return it to the supply and lose 2 time. This means you must move your life time track marker 2 spaces forward in clockwise direction.</p>\n\n<p>You may then perform the action of the action space from which you took the influence or plague cube. You are allowed to only take the cube and not carry out the action. </p>\n\n<h4>The currency time</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/currency.jpg\" class=\"floatr\"><p>Whenever you perform an action that costs time (every hourglass represents one unit of time), you must move your marker on your life time track forward (clockwise) the appropriate number of spaces. In addition, you lose 2 time whenever you take a plague cube. As soon as your marker passes the bridge, one of your oldest family members passes away.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The actions</h2>\n\n<h3>Grain harvest</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/grainharvest.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If you have one or more family members on your farmyard, then they may perform a harvest action. Immediately take 2 bags of grain from the supply and place them onto the appropriate spaces of your farmyard. If you do not have any family members on your farmyard, then you cannot perform this action.</p>\n\n<p>If you also own a horse and a plow, take 3 bags of grain instead. If you also own an ox and a plow, take 4 bags of grain instead.</p>\n\n<p>(You may never use more than one combination, i.e., several family members, plows, oxen, or horses are of no additional use during a harvest).</p>\n\n<p>Your goods are not used up during the harvest. So - for example - when using an ox and a plow with the harvest, you do not need to discard them. Your family members remain on your farmyard.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Each farmyard has a capacity of 5 bags of grain! You can never own more than 5 bags of grain at once.</p>\n\n<h3>Family</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/family.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>This action represents a new family member being born. Immediately take one family member of your color from the general supply and add it to your farmyard. You must always take the family member with the lowest available number from the supply.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Peter has one family member with the number \"2\", two with the number \"3\", and two with the number \"4\" left in the supply. He must take the \"2\" family member.</p>\n\n<p>Important: Instead of taking a new family member from the supply, you may use this action to instead return one of your employed family members (not yet deceased) from the game board to your farmyard.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Family members added to the game board during one of the following actions (or added to the black bag by means of the \"church\" action) must always come directly from your farmyard.</p>\n\n<h3>Crafts</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/crafts.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>This action allows you to produce one good in one of the 5 craft buildings. (Take the corresponding goods tile and put it next to your farmyard). At the mill, you get 2 coins instead. There are two ways of producing a good. At each craft building (except the mill), you may choose:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a) to pay for the produced good with time (for this you also need a family member in the craft building) OR</li>\n<li>b) to pay for the produced good with influence cubes (or bags of grain, depending on the good)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>a) Acquire good by losing time</h4>\n\n<p>If you want to pay for a good with time, you first need to train a family member in the appropriate craft building. Place a family member from your farmyard onto the craft building that you want to use. This costs you a certain amount of time (the number of hourglass symbols next to the image of the gray family member on the building's roof).</p>\n\n<p>You may then immediately produce the corresponding good by paying as much time as indicated by the production arrow on the building's roof.</p>\n\n<p>Your family member will remain on the same craft building for the rest of the game (unless he dies or returns to the farmyard by means of the \"family\" action). As long as he remains on the craft building, you may produce a good again by means of the \"crafts\" action. In doing so, you now only pay as much time as indicated in the production arrow (since your family member is already trained).</p>\n\n<p>Note: Family members may only produce the good of the craft buildings they are placed onto. (A blacksmith can only produce plows, not scrolls). There is no limit to how many family members, regardless of colors, may be on any building. (Exception: Players may not place family members onto the mill).</p>\n\n<h4>b) Acquire goods by paying with influence cubes (or bags of grain)</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/acquiregoods.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you have a family member on a craft building or not, you may purchase the good that the building produces by returning the specified amount of influence cubes (or bags of grain in the stables) to the supply. You do not need to have a family member on the craft building. (In the example on the left, Philipp could have also acquired the wagon by returning 1 orange and 1 pink influence cube to the supply - without placing a family member and losing time).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/overview.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Market</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/market.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>This action triggers a market day in which all players can participate. This action must be carried out. A market day must be held.</p>\n\n<p>If you triggered the action, then you are the first player allowed to serve one available customer. Available customers are all customers directly in front of the stalls on spaces with blue borders. (The customers on the remaining 5 spaces are in the waiting line and cannot be served).</p>\n\n<p>Each customer wants certain goods and/or bags of grain. To serve the customer, return the required goods and/or the required amount of grain to the supply, take the customer tile, and put it face down next to your farmyard. At the end of the game, this customer is worth however many prestige points are printed on it.</p>\n\n<p>Then - in clockwise direction - the remaining players take their turns. Each player may choose one of the remaining customers. However, in addition to delivering the required goods and bags of grain, the other players must also pay 1 green influence cube and 1 time. Players that do not want to or are unable to sell anything must pass and may not later re-enter the current market day.</p>\n\n<p>When it is your turn again, you may serve another of the remaining customers. This time, however, you must also pay 1 green influence cube and 1 time. (Only your first sale is free).</p>\n\n<p>The market day continues in clockwise direction until all customers have been served or all players have passed.</p>\n\n<p>The market day then ends. Depending on the number of players, fill up the blue bordered spaces with new customers. This is done by moving the waiting customers up in order. Then refill the waiting line with new customers from the pile. (If no customers were served, all customer tiles remain in place).</p>\n\n<p>Note: Should all customers be served at some point, then the market stalls remain empty for the rest of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/travel.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>This action allows you to send a family member out into the world. If you do not have any family members on the travel map of the game board, then take a family member from your farmyard and place him on one of the two neighboring cities that can be reached from the village. You must pay the cost of the trip, shown on the path. You will certainly have to pay 2 time and return 1 wagon to the supply.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, depending on which way you go, you will also have to return either 2 brown or 2 pink influence cubes to the supply. Take one of your markers and place it onto the city traveled to. This gets you the reward shown in the circle (3 prestige points).</p>\n\n<p>If you already have at least one family member on a city on the travel map, you can choose:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Either send another family member from your farmyard to one of the two neighboring cities OR</li>\n<li>move one of your family members that is already on a city to an adjacent city. Adjacent cities are all cities directly accessible via a path (without skipping over another city). You must again pay the cost of the trip and put a marker onto the city you reached. You then receive the city's reward (2 influence cubes of your choice from the supply, 1 coin, or 3 prestige points).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: You can only place a marker and thus receive a city's reward once per city. Should your family member travel to a city where you already have a marker, then you may neither place another marker nor receive the reward.</p>\n\n<p>There is no limit to the number of family members and different colored markers allowed on any city. At the end of the game, you will receive prestige points depending on the total number of cities that your family visited during the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Council chamber</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/councilchamber.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>This action allows you to exert influence in the council chamber. You may use the action in 3 different ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a) Take a family member from your farmyard and place him on the 1st stage of the council chamber. This costs 1 time and 2 green influence cubes OR 1 time and 1 scroll. You may perform the privilege action of this stage (to become the next starting player). OR</li> <li>b) Move one of your family members already in the council chamber one stage forward. This again costs you either 1 scroll OR 2 green influence cubes. Additionally, you must pay either 2 or 3 time depending on the stage. You may perform the privilege action which is shown below either the current or a previous stage of your family member. OR</li> <li>c) If you already have at least one family member in the council chamber, then you may perform a privilege action without moving a family member. In this case, perform the privilege action shown below either its current or a previous stage for free.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Overview of the privileges:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><b>1st stage:</b> Take the next starting player marker from the council chamber. If the marker has already been taken by another player, you receive nothing. If you take the marker, then you will be the starting player in the next round. At the beginning of the next round, take the starting player marker and return the next starting player marker to its designated space in the council chamber.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>2nd stage:</b> Take 2 influence cubes of your choice from the supply.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>3rd stage:</b> Take 1 goods tile of your choice from the supply and put it next to your farmyard.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>4th stage:</b> Pay exactly 1 coin to the supply in exchange for 3 prestige points on the prestige track.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/stages.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is no limit to the number of family members allowed on any stage. At the end of the game, each family member that has reached at least the 2nd stage in the council chamber is worth prestige points.</p>\n\n<h3>Church</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/church.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You may add one family member from your farmyard to the black bag. For doing this, you must pay either 1 brown influence cube (returned to the supply) OR 3 time.</p>\n\n<p>Family members added to the black bag may be drawn and placed onto the church during a mass. A mass is said at the end of each round as well as at the end of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Well (substitute action)</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/well.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Instead of taking a cube from an action space, you may instead return 3 same-colored influence cubes to the supply (but not plague cubes). For this, you may carry out any one of the previously listed actions.</p>\n\n<p>Note: The well action is only possible as long as there is at least one cube left on any action space. By the way: This is the only way to perform an action when there is no cube left on the corresponding action space.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of a round</h2>\n\n<p>When a player takes the last cube from the board (i.e., all action spaces are empty), he first carries out his action as usual. The current round is then finished and a mass is said.</p>\n\n<p>Each mass consists of 3 phases:</p>\n\n<h4>1. Draw 4 pieces from the black bag</h4>\n\n<p>Thoroughly shuffle the family members and black monks in the black bag. Then draw exactly 4 pieces from the bag, either at random or deliberately by paying coins. Beginning with the starting player and then continuing in clockwise direction, each player may pick one or more of their family members from the bag by paying 1 coin per family member. (Since there are always 4 black monks in the bag, this is the only way to make sure that your family members are drawn).</p>\n\n<p>Once a total of 4 family members have been bought from the bag, no more pieces may be drawn. Should fewer than 4 family members have been bought from the bag, bring the total count up to 4 pieces by drawing the rest randomly. Once you have drawn 4 pieces, return all black monks to the bag. Place any family members drawn on the large rightmost glass window of the church. Family members that are still in the bag remain there and may be drawn during the next mass.</p>\n\n<h4>2. Move family members up in the church hierarchy</h4>\n\n<p>Once 4 pieces have been drawn from the bag (even if they were only black monks), each player may move one or even several of his family members up in the church hierarchy (move them leftward on the windows). Beginning with the starting player and then continuing in clockwise direction, each player may do this once. To move a family member to the next window on the left, you must return as many bags of grain to the supply as are shown between the windows. Your family members may even move up more than one window, provided you pay enough grain to cover all movement.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Award 2 prestige points for the church majority</h4>\n\n<p>At the end of the mass, the player who has the most family members in the church immediately gains 2 prestige points on the prestige track. In the case of a tie, the prestige points are awarded to the player whose family member is on the window the furthest to the left. If there is still a tie, then each of the tied players gains 2 prestige points.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, each family member in the church is worth prestige points, depending on how far up it has moved.</p>\n\n<h4>Beginning a new round</h4>\n\n<p>If a player has acquired the next starting player marker during the previous round, then he now takes the starting player marker and returns the next starting player marker to its designated space in the council chamber. Otherwise, the starting player remains the same. The new round starts again by filling the green bag with cubes and seeding the action spaces.</p>\n\n<h4>The coins</h4>\n\n<p>You get coins at the mill or while traveling. There are 3 possible ways to use coins:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>To buy prestige points in the council chamber (final stage).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>To ensure your family members are chosen from the black bag during a mass.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>As a JOKER for any one influence cube.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, each coin you did not spend is worth 1 prestige point.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>A family member passes away</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/passesaway.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>During the game, you must often pay for actions with time by moving the marker on your life time track forward in clockwise direction. Once you move the marker past the bridge, one of your oldest family members passes away. You first get to finish carrying out your chosen action in full and must only decide which of your oldest family members dies at the end of your turn.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: Anyone who moves his marker past the bridge during a market day must immediately choose which of his family members dies.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/graves2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Of your family members, it is always the one with the lowest number that has to die. If you have several family members with the lowest number, you can choose one of them. A dying family member must be visible at the time of his death. This means that he must be either on the game board or on your farmyard. (Family members still in the black bag cannot die, nor can ones that have not yet entered play).</p>\n\n<p>Example: Peter chooses the \"crafts\" action by taking a plague cube from the corresponding action space. He loses 2 time in doing so, moving his marker on the life time track past the bridge.</p>\n\n<p>Before one of his family members dies, he may still perform the \"crafts\" action. He places a \"1\" family member from his farmyard onto the smithy (which costs him 3 time) and produces a plow (which costs him yet another 3 time). Now that his action is over, his family member with the lowest number must die. He has two \"1\" family members on the game board and decides to choose to let the craftsman he just placed onto the smithy die.</p>\n\n<p>For a dying family member, there are always two possibilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><b>a) There is still a free space in the village chronicle</b></p>\n\n<p>The village chronicle records the stories of the great residents and their deeds. The village chronicle has a few spaces open for each professional category. Depending on where the family member \"worked\" at the time of his death, he is added to one of the following empty spaces:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/banners.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, you receive prestige points depending on how many of your family members were immortalized in the village chronicle.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>b) There is no proper grave left in the village chronicle</b></p>\n\n<p>In this case, the family member is put onto one of the anonymous graves next to the church. Here he can rest in peace, but is not worth any prestige points.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: Family members that have died should always be laid down so you can easily tell them apart from the still living, upright family members.</p>\n\n<p>Hint 1: It is an effective strategy to add family members to the village chronicle quickly. So don't be afraid of paying for actions with time.</p>\n\n<p>Hint 2: If you are putting a family member from your farmyard onto the game board, you should always consider the family member's number. \"1\" family members are likely to die during the game. If you want to score in the church or council chamber at the end of the game, placing family members with higher numbers is usually the better choice.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<p>The end of the game is triggered when a family member is put onto either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>a) the last empty space in the village chronicle or<br><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/village_chronicle.jpg\"><br></p></li>\n\n<li><p>b) the last empty anonymous grave next to the church<br><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/grave.jpg\"><br></p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The player who put his family member onto the last empty space of the village chronicle or the last empty anonymous grave does not get another turn.</p>\n\n<p>All other players may perform one last action in clockwise player order. As always, you must either take an influence or plague cube from an action space or pay 3 same-colored influence cubes to perform the action. Should the final cube be taken from the game board (even though there are players left to act), the action spaces are not reseeded. Instead, the remaining players may perform any action without having to return 3 same-colored influence cubes to the supply.</p>\n\n<p>Note: In this case, the usual mass at the end of a round is skipped. The final mass is not said until all players have taken their final action.</p>\n\n<p>Note: If family members die during the final actions and there are no proper village chronicle spaces or graves left, then they are simply removed from the game.</p>\n\n<p><b>Special case:</b> If the end of the game is triggered during a market day, finish the market day completely. Afterward, determine who has triggered the end of the game by occupying the last chronicle space or grave. If it is the same player who also triggered the market day, then he has taken his last turn and everyone else has one action left.</p>\n\n<p>If it was triggered by a different player, then all players, in clockwise player order, may carry out one more action. (The final turn of the game is then taken by the player who triggered the market day). After each player has taken his last action, the last mass is said. Final scoring then takes place.</p>\n\n<h3>Final Scoring</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/final_scoring.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Each time you receive prestige points, score them by moving your marker forward on the prestige track. Whoever gained the most prestige points wins the game.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a tie, the tied player who has served the most customers wins. If there is still a tie, the tied player with the higher number of \"living\" family members wins.</p>\n\n<h4>Travel</h4>\n\n<p>Count the number of cities that your family has visited on the travel map (= number of markers of your color) and gain prestige points accordingly:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 city = 1 point</li>\n<li>2 cities = 3 points</li>\n<li>3 cities = 6 points</li>\n<li>4 cities = 10 points</li>\n<li>5 cities = 14 points</li>\n<li>6 cities = 18 points</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Council chamber</h4>\n\n<p>Each family member on the 4th stage is worth 6 points. Each family member on the 3rd stage is worth 4 points. Each family member on the 2nd stage is worth 2 points. On the 1st stage, there are no points awarded.</p>\n\n<h4>Church</h4>\n\n<p>Each family member on the rightmost window is worth 2 points. Each family member on the second window is worth 3 points. Each family member on the third window is worth 4 points.</p>\n\n<p>Each family member on the leftmost window is worth 6 points. Family members in the black bag are not worth any points.</p>\n\n<h4>Village chronicle</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/village/family2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>You gain prestige points depending on how many of your family members are immortalized in the village chronicle.</p>\n\n<p>1 or 2 are worth no points. 3 family members are worth 4 prestige points. 4 family members are worth 7 points. 5 or more family members are worth 12 points.</p>\n\n<h4>Customer tiles</h4>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, each player reveals their concealed customer tiles and receives the prestige points printed on them.</p>\n\n<h4>Coins</h4>\n\n<p>Each coin is worth 1 prestige point.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"buy-board-game.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Income</h2>\n\n<p>Collect new Workers, Coins, Priests, and Power.</p>\n\n<p>You also go through this phase on the 1st round. Consequently, you first collect your faction-specific starting income and then also the income for the 1st round.</p>\n\n<p>Your income depends on the Structures you have built, on the Bonus card you have chosen, and (later in the game) on the Favor tiles you own. On all components, income is symbolized by an open hand.</p>\n\n<h4>Basic income for Structures</h4>\n\n<p><b>Workers:</b> Take a number of Workers from the general supply equal to the number of visible Worker symbols on your Dwelling track.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/basicincome.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><b>Coins:</b> Take a number of Coins from the general supply equal to the number of visible Coin symbols on your Trading house track.</p>\n\n<p><b>Priests:</b> Take a number of Priests from your supply equal to the number of visible Priest symbols on your Temple track. Another Priest symbol will be visible once you have built your Sanctuary.</p>\n\n<p>Both the Swarmlings' Sanctuary and the Darklings' Sanctuary provide 2 Priests.</p>\n\n<p>Put the newly gained Workers, Coins, and Priests on your Faction board. If the supply of Workers or Coins runs out, replace the missing components with something else. Only your supply of Priests is limited.</p>\n\n<p><b>Power:</b> Power is gained according to the visible Power symbols on the Trading house track. The Stronghold usually provides additional Power (except for the Alchemists who collect 6 Coins instead, or the Chaos Magicians who collect 2 Workers instead, or the Fakirs who collect 1 Priest instead).</p>\n\n<h4>Additional income for cards and tiles</h4>\n\n<p>Beside the income collected via your Faction board, add the income depicted on your Bonus card.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/additionalincome.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>The Bowls of Power</h4>\n\n<p>Each player has 12 Power tokens that are distributed among three Bowls. Power actions require Power in Bowl III (the one on the right).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/bowls1.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Whenever you gain Power in the game (as income, when an opponent builds Structures, or by advancing on the Cult tracks), you do not get new Power tokens, but rather move the existing ones from Bowl to Bowl. Also, when spending Power on a Power action, you do not lose Power tokens, but move them around again.</p>\n\n<p>Power tokens move (always in clockwise order) according to the following rules:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/bowls2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When gaining Power, proceed in the following order.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>If there are Power tokens in Bowl I, for each 1 Power you gain move one token from Bowl I to Bowl II.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Once Bowl I is empty, for each 1 Power you gain move one token from Bowl II to Bowl III.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Once all Power tokens are in Bowl III, you cannot gain further Power.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p> You can only spend Power tokens that are in Bowl III. Move them to Bowl I when spending them.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase II. Actions</h2>\n\n<p>During the Action phase, beginning with the Starting player and in clockwise order, each player takes exactly one Action. Continue to do so until no player wants to take any more Actions.</p>\n\n<p>There are eight possible Actions to choose from. Except for passing, all Actions can be taken multiple times during the same Action phase (but only once per turn).</p>\n\n<h3>1. Transform and Build</h3>\n\n<p>First, you may change the type of one Terrain space. Then, if you have changed its type to your Home terrain, you may immediately build a Dwelling on that space.</p>\n\n<h4>Building a Dwelling</h4>\n\n<p>In order to build a Dwelling on a Terrain space, this space needs to be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>of your color (i.e. it needs to be your Home terrain)</li>\n<li>unoccupied</li>\n<li>directly or indirectly adjacent to one of your</li>\n<li>Structures (\"Adjacency\" is defined in the next section).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, you need to pay its building costs. Each Dwelling costs 1 Worker and 2 Coins. (Exceptions: The Engineers build Dwellings for 1 Worker and 1 Coin, the Swarmlings for 2 Workers and 3 Coins).</p>\n\n<h4>Transforming a Terrain space</h4>\n\n<p>To ensure the first condition is met, you are allowed to transform one unoccupied Terrain space into your Home terrain immediately before building a Dwelling. Place a Terrain tile of your color on that space.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/spade.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Transformation has its price: Each step between the source and destination terrain on the Transformation cycle of your Faction board costs 1 Spade. Thus, transforming adjacent types of terrain (on the Transformation cycle) into one another costs 1 Spade, with a maximum cost of up to 3 Spades if they are on opposite sides of the cycle as you can move in either direction on the cycle.</p>\n\n<p>(Exception: Giants always have to pay exactly 2 Spades to transform any type of terrain into their Home terrain).</p>\n\n<p>Spades can be acquired in a variety of ways. You may exchange Workers for Spades. The Exchange track of your Faction board displays the Exchange rate: At the beginning of the game, this is usually 3 Workers for 1 Spade (see Action #3).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/exchangerate.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>1 or 2 Spades can be acquired via certain Power actions. One of the Bonus cards provides 1 Spade.</p>\n\n<p>(Halflings and Giants gain additional Spades for immediate use after building their Stronghold).</p>\n\n<p>Spades may only be applied to a single Terrain space. However, there are two special cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>If the Spades gained via a Power action or Bonus card do not suffice to transform a Terrain space into your Home terrain, you may exchange Workers for the missing Spades (at the current Exchange rate of your Exchange track).</p></li> <li><p>When gaining 2 Spades, if you only need one of them to transform a Terrain space into your Home terrain, you may apply the second Spade on another Terrain space. However, you may not place a Dwelling on this second space.</p>\n\n<p>(The same is true when the Halflings build their Stronghold, immediately gaining 3 Spades, see last page).</p>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Details on building Dwellings</h4>\n\n<p>When building, take Structures (incl. Dwellings) from left to right off your Faction board. If the current Scoring tile depicts a Dwelling, you get 2 Victory points for each Dwelling you build. This Scoring tile awards 2 Victory points for building Dwellings.</p>\n\n<h4>Details on using Spades</h4>\n\n<p>You may not save Spades for future Actions. Spades need to be used immediately.</p>\n\n<p>If the left side of the current Scoring tile depicts a Spade, you get Victory points for using Spades during the current Action phase. This Scoring tile awards 2 Victory points for using Spades.</p>\n\n<p>After transforming a Terrain space, you do not need to build a Dwelling immediately. You can do this in another Action at a later point in time.</p>\n\n<p>You do not need to transform a Terrain space into your Home terrain, you may stop at any other type of terrain (e.g. if you can not afford more Spades). However, during their turns, your opponents may claim that Terrain space for themselves. (Terrain spaces with Terrain tiles on them but no Structures are considered unoccupied).</p>\n\n<p>Even when transforming a Terrain space without building a Dwelling, the transformed Terrain space needs to be directly or indirectly adjacent to one of your Structures.</p>\n\n<p>You may not transform a Terrain space containing Structures. You may also get Spades via Cult bonuses. As these Spades are gained outside the Action phase, you may not build a Dwelling immediately afterwards, nor do you get to exchange Workers for more Spades. (You have to wait for the next Action phase to build a Dwelling).</p>\n\n<h4>Adjacency</h4>\n\n<p>Due to some other rules, it is important to distinguish between direct and indirect adjacency of Terrain spaces. (This distinction does not matter when building Dwellings, which is what this section is all about).</p>\n\n<h4>Direct adjacency</h4>\n\n<p>Terrain spaces and Structures are considered directly adjacent to one another if they share a hexagon edge. Additionally, Terrain spaces and Structures separated by a River but connected via a Bridge are also considered directly adjacent to one another.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/adjaceny1.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Indirect adjacency</h4>\n\n<p>Terrain spaces and Structures are considered indirectly adjacent to one another if they are (not directly adjacent to one another, but) separated by one or more River spaces and your Shipping value is high enough to cover the distance. (Shipping is another Action and will be explained in the next section).</p>\n\n<p>Terrain spaces and Structures that Dwarves can reach via Tunneling and Fakirs via Carpet Flight are also considered indirectly adjacent to one another.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/adjaceny2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Note: When building Dwellings, your opponents get the chance to gain Power. This will be explained in Action #4 \"Upgrading a Structure\". Before that, let us have a look at the following two Actions that facilitate building Dwellings for the remainder of the game: advancing on the Shipping track and lowering the Exchange rate for Spades.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Advancing on the Shipping track</h3>\n\n<p>Terrain spaces and Structures need to be indirectly adjacent to one another if you want to expand beyond River spaces.</p>\n\n<p>In order to transform Terrain spaces or build Structures beyond River spaces, as an Action, you may move the Marker on your Shipping track forward one space. Your Faction board displays the costs of this Action: 1 Priest and 4 Coins.</p>\n\n<p>As a reward for taking this Action, get a number of Victory points as indicated on the Shipping space you move to.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Lowering the Exchange rate for Spades</h3>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the game, Spades cost 3 Workers each (see Action #1). In order to reduce this cost down to 2 Workers or even down to 1 Worker, as an Action, you may move the Marker on your Exchange track up one space. Your Faction board displays the costs of this Action: 2 Workers, 5 Coins, and 1 Priest.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: Halflings pay fewer Coins, and Darklings do not even have an Exchange track as they exchange Priests for Spades.</p>\n\n<p>As a reward for taking this Action, you get 6 Victory points.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Upgrading a Structure</h3>\n\n<p>Structures can be upgraded step by step. The costs for each upgrade are depicted on the Faction board to the left of a Structure.</p>\n\n<p>Always take newly placed Structures from left to right off your Faction board.</p>\n\n<p>When upgrading, you are replacing Structures by one another. Take the Structure that you wish to upgrade off the Game board and return it to your Faction board. This reduces your income for the given type of Structure. (When returning Structures to your Faction board, always put them as far to the right as possible on their proper track). Place the new Structure on the same space on the Game board where the just removed Structure has been. When building a Trading house, return a Dwelling to your Faction board.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/upgrade.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>There are four possible upgrades (two of which can only be done once per game).</p>\n\n<p>Upgrading a Dwelling to a Trading house costs 2 Workers and 6 Coins. If there is at least one opponent's Structure directly adjacent to that Dwelling, you only need to pay 3 Coins instead of 6. If the current Scoring tile depicts a Trading house, get 3 Victory points for this upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Upgrading a Trading house to a Stronghold costs a number of Workers and Coins depending on the faction. After building its Stronghold, each faction gains a specific special ability.</p>\n\n<p>If the current Scoring tile depicts a Stronghold, get 5 Victory points for this upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Upgrading a Trading house to a Temple costs 2 Workers and 5 Coins. As a reward, immediately choose and take one Favor tile and put it face-up in front of you. You may immediately take advantage of the newly gained Favor tile, or use it during the current Action phase, respectively). You may not take a Favor tile that you already have.</p>\n\n<p>Upgrading a Temple to a Sanctuary costs a number of Workers and Coins depending on the faction. This is also awarded with a Favor tile. If the current Scoring tile depicts a Sanctuary, get 5 Victory points for this upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, more about the already mentioned rewards you get when an opponent builds a Structure.</p>\n\n<h4>Power via Structures</h4>\n\n<p>Each Structure has a Power value. The Power value of each Structure is depicted to the right of its track on the Faction board:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/power.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>When building a Dwelling (Action #1) or upgrading a Structure (Action #4), you must inform the owners of Structures directly adjacent to your Structure that they may gain Power.</p>\n\n<p>In order to determine the total number of Power an opponent may gain, add up the Power values of their Structures directly adjacent to your newly built Structure.</p>\n\n<p>You do not gain Power for your own Structures. Power can only be gained when an opponent builds Structures.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with the player to the left of the active player and in clockwise order, each affected opponent needs to decide whether to actually gain the Power or not. The next section explains why you might want to refuse to gain Power.</p>\n\n<h4>The price of Power</h4>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Power gained via Structures is not free. To gain that Power, you need to lose a number of Victory points equal to one fewer than the number of Power gained.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, gaining 1/2/3/4/… Power costs 0/1/2/3/… Victory points.</p>\n\n<p>You may not end up with a negative score when losing Victory points.</p>\n\n<p>You may not gain less Power in order to save Victory points. Either take it all or gain nothing. (Exceptions: If you have not enough Power tokens in Bowls I and II, gain as many Power as needed to move all of them to Bowl III and lose Victory points accordingly. Also, you may gain less Power to avoid a negative score. In this case, only gain as many Power as needed to end up with 0 Victory points).</p>\n\n<p>You only lose Victory points when gaining Power via Structures. You do not lose any Victory points when gaining Power otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>You gain Power:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>when an opponent builds Structures (as explained above).</li>\n<li>as income from your Trading houses and Stronghold (and Temples if you are playing the Engineers).</li>\n<li>as income from two specific Bonus cards.</li>\n<li>as income from two specific Favor tiles.</li>\n<li>as a one-time reward when founding a Town and taking the specific Town tile (see page 14 for details on founding a Town).</li>\n<li>as a one-time Cult bonus in Phase III if the specific Scoring tile is up for the current round.</li>\n<li>when advancing on the Cult tracks.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Power via Cult tracks</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/culttracks.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Power can also be gained on the Cult tracks of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. You gain 1/2/2/3 Power when advancing to the 3rd/5th/7th/10th space of a Cult track. You only gain this Power once when advancing to or passing by these spaces.</p>\n\n<p>The Nomad player (yellow) gains 4 Power for advancing these 3 spaces in the Cult of Air. Only one player on space 10 Only one player may advance to space 10 of each Cult track. To do so, you also need to have founded a Town for each space 10 you want to advance to. See page 14 for details on founding a Town.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>5. Send a Priest to the Order of a Cult</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/priest.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>There are 4 spaces below each of the Cult tracks of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air that each can hold exactly 1 Priest. As an Action, you may place one of your Priests on one such space to advance 3 or 2 spaces (as indicated on the space) on the corresponding Cult track.</p>\n\n<p>You may gain Power when advancing on a track (see \"Power via Cult tracks\" above).</p>\n\n<p>There is no way of getting these Priests back. Keep in mind that you only have a total of 7 Priests at your disposal.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not want to lose a Priest, alternatively, return him to your supply (next to your Faction board) and only advance 1 space.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Power actions</h3>\n\n<p>There are two types of Power actions: fully-fledged Actions and auxiliary Actions.</p>\n\n<h4>Power actions on the Game board</h4>\n\n<p>The Power actions on the Game board (indicated by orange octagons) may only be taken once per round. First come, first served.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever taking one of these Actions, move a number of Power tokens from Bowl III to Bowl I equal to its indicated cost. Then, put an Action token on its space on the Game board to indicate that this Action may not be taken any more this round.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/poweractions.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/conversions.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Sacrificing Power</h4>\n\n<p>f you do not have enough Power in Bowl III to take a specific Power or Conversion action, on top of your Action, you may move Power tokens from Bowl II to Bowl III and then immediately take the desired Action. However, for each Power token moved in this fashion, you need to remove 1 Power token from Bowl II from the game. From now on, you will irrevocably have to deal with fewerPower tokens in your cycle. (You may not sacrifice Power if you only have 1 Power token in Bowl II).</p>\n\n<h3>7. Special actions</h3>\n\n<p>Each Special action may be taken only once per round.</p>\n\n<p>Special actions, like Power actions, are indicated by orange octagons and can be gained in a variety of ways.</p>\n\n<p>Some factions unlock a Special action when building their Stronghold.</p>\n\n<p>One Favor tile and one Bonus card provide a Special action to advance 1 space on a Cult track. Another Bonus card provides a free Spade for transforming a Terrain space.</p>\n\n<p>Use Action tokens to cover taken Special actions.</p>\n\n<h3>8. Passing and new Starting player</h3>\n\n<p>On your turn, if you cannot or do not want to take any more Action, you have to pass and stop taking Actions for the remainder of this round.</p>\n\n<p>The first player to pass becomes the Starting player for the next round (and takes the Starting player token).</p>\n\n<p>When passing, immediately return your Bonus card and take one of the three available ones. This may be a card another player has already returned this round.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: Do not take any Bonus cards in the last round of the game - round 6). If there were Coins on the newly taken Bonus card, put them on your Faction board.</p>\n\n<p>You may get Victory points when returning certain Bonus cards.</p>\n\n<p>When passing and returning the Bonus card depicted on the right, get 1 Victory point for each of your Dwellings on the Game board. When passing and returning the Bonus card depicted on the left, get 2 Victory points for each of your Trading houses on the Game board.</p>\n\n<p>When passing and returning the Bonus card depicted on the right, get 4 Victory points if you have already built your Stronghold and/or 4 Victory points if you have already built your Sanctuary.</p>\n\n<p>Hint: Do not forget to get these Victory points. Always pay attention to the current Scoring tile: you may get Victory points for building certain Structures, for using Spades, or founding Towns.</p>\n\n<p>Freely choose which one of the three available Bonus cards you want to take. (You may not immediately take the card that you have just returned).</p>\n\n<p>You may wish to put the newly taken Bonus card face-down in front of you to indicate that you have already passed.</p>\n\n<p>There is no limitation for how many resources you may keep for the next round.</p>\n\n<p>You may take as many Actions as you wish, even if all other players have already passed. As long as there is at least one player left taking Actions, the current Action phase continues.</p>\n\n<h3>9. Founding a Town</h3>\n\n<p>During the course of the game, one or more Towns may be founded. Towns are founded automatically whenever these two conditions are met:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>There are at least 4 Structures of one color directly adjacent to one another.</p>\n\n<p>Exception: Only 3 Structures are required if one of them is a Sanctuary.</p>\n\n</li>\n\n<li><p>These Structures have a combined Power value of at least 7.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/founding.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Indicate a founded Town by choosing and taking a Town tile and placing it under one of the Structures forming that Town.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/towntile.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Benefits of founding a Town</h4>\n\n<p>Immediately get a number of Victory points as indicated by the chosen Town tile. Get additional Victory points if the current Scoring tile depicts a key.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately and only once, collect the rewards depicted on the chosen Town tile (either +1 space on each of the Cult tracks, 1 Priest, 2 Workers, 6 Coins, or 8 Power).</p>\n\n<p>Each Town provides a key. Each key allows you to advance to the last space of one Cult track (space 10). (Without a key, you have to stop at space 9).</p>\n\n<p>When founding a Town, all Structures directly adjacent to one another form that Town (Bridges are key here), even if there are more than the required number of Structures.</p>\n\n<p>Indirect adjacency (especially via River spaces) has no relevance when founding a Town. (Exception: The Mermaids may ignore any one River space when founding a Town).</p>\n\n<p>Building new Structures directly adjacent to an existing Town expands that Town rather than forming a new one.</p>\n\n<p>When a Structure is built combining two existing Towns to one larger Town, these Towns do not lose their individual rights or functions (despite the fact that you cannot tell anymore where their borders are).</p>\n\n<p>The total number of Towns for one game is limited to 10.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase III Cult Bonuses and Clean-Up Phase</h2>\n\n<p>When all players have passed (see Action #8 on the left), the current Action phase is over. In rounds 1 to 5, the Action phase is followed by a Clean-up phase preparing the next round.</p>\n\n<p>There is no Clean-up phase after the last round.</p>\n\n<h4>Cult Bonuses</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/cultbonus.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>First, the Cult bonuses depicted on the current Scoring tile need to be awarded. Each player with enough progress in the depicted Cults gets the depicted reward, multiple times if need be.</p>\n\n<p>The Cult bonuses are awarded in the play order of the next round. This is relevant for Spades.</p>\n\n<p>You may not acquire additional Spades when getting them as a Cult bonus. Neither may the Fakirs do a Carpet Flight, nor the Dwarves do Tunneling when getting Spades as a Cult bonus. A Carpet Flight and Tunneling have costs that cannot be paid outside the Action phase. Also, if the Giants get only a single Spade as a Cult bonus, this Spade will be forfeit.</p>\n\n<p>You may not save Spades for future turns. You may apply these Spades on different adjacent Terrain spaces.</p>\n\n<p>You may not build a Dwelling in Phase III.</p>\n\n<h4>Return Action tokens</h4>\n\n<p>If there are any Action tokens on: Power action spaces on the Game board, Special action spaces on Faction boards, or Favor tiles and Bonus cards, remove them from there.</p>\n\n<h4>Coins on Bonus cards</h4>\n\n<p>Put 1 Coin from the general supply on each of the three leftover Bonus cards. (If a card has not been taken by any player for two rounds, it will now have 2 Coins on it).</p>\n\n<h4>Turn the Scoring tile face-down</h4>\n\n<p>As the last act of the current round, turn the current Scoring tile facedown so that only the Scoring tiles of the following rounds remain face-up.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/box.jpg\" class=\"floatr margin-top-5 margin-bottom-10\">\n\n<p>The game ends after all players have passed in the Action phase of the last round. Afterwards, there is a final scoring. (As indicated by the Game end token, there are no Cult bonuses in the final round).</p>\n\n<h4>Cult scoring</h4>\n\n<p>Score each of the four Cult tracks individually:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>8 Victory points for the player highest on a track.</li>\n<li>4 Victory points for the player second highest on a track.</li>\n<li>2 Victory points for the player third highest on a track.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These values are also depicted in the top left corner of the Game board. You cannot gain any Victory points when being still on space 0. In case of a tie, evenly divide the Victory points of the respective tiers among the tied players (round down if necessary).</p>\n\n<h4>Area scoring</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/terra-mystica/areascoring.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Determine the number of your Structures directly or indirectly adjacent to one another. With the proper Shipping value, scattered areas may be indirectly adjacent to one another (and, thus, considered connected).</p>\n\n<p>The player with the highest number of connected Structures gets 18 Victory points. The player with the second highest number of connected Structures gets 12 Victory points. And the player with the third highest number of connected Structures gets 6 Victory points.</p>\n\n<p>These values are also depicted in the top left corner of the Game board. In case of a tie, evenly divide the Victory points of the respective tiers among the tied players (round down if necessary).</p>\n\n<h4>Resource scoring</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, get Victory points for left-over resources: get 1 Victory point per 3 Coins. (All other resources may be converted to Coins for this purpose).</p>\n\n<p>The Alchemists get 1 Victory point per 2 Coins.</p>\n\n<h4>The winner of the game</h4>\n\n<p>The player with the highest number of Victory points wins the game. In case of a tie, there is more than one winner.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"setup.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Your glass pieces are represented by dice, which have a color and a shade - indicated by the values on the dice (the lower the value the lighter the shade).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/sagrada/shades.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Each round, players will take turns drafting from a pool of dice, placing these dice on their window.</p>\n\n<p>Players must place them within the color and shade restrictions on their Window card, and never have adjacent dice of the same color or value.</p>\n\n<p>After 10 rounds, players score points based on public and private objectives - the highest scoring artisan is the winner!</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<h3>Player Setup</h3>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">1</s> Shuffle the Private Objective Cards (Gray die on the back) and give 1 to each player face down. Players may secretly look at this card.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">2</s> Give each player 2 random Window Pattern Cards and 1 Window Frame Player Board. Each player selects 1 of the 4 Window Patterns to play (front or back), the other card isn't used. +Note: Windows have varying difficulty from level 3 (easiest) to 6 (hardest) as indicated near the name. Difficult windows give more Favor Tokens</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">3</s> Give each player the number of Favor Tokens indicated by the difficulty number on their card.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">4</s> Slide the selected Window Pattern Card into the bottom of the Player Board.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">5</s> Place a Score Marker that matches the color of each player's board next to the Round Track, these are used during End Game Scoring.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/sagrada/setup.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel2\">A</s> Place the Round Track near the center of the play area.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel2\">B</s> Shuffle all of the Tool Cards and place 3 face up in the center of the play area.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel2\">C</s> Shuffle all of the Public Objective cards (Blue die on the back) and place 3 face up.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel2\">D</s> Place all 90 dice in the Dice Bag.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel2\">E</s> Randomly select a player to be the Start Player and give them the Dice Bag. One suggested method is whoever most recently visited a cathedral.</p>\n\n<p>Set aside all remaining Objective, Tool and Window Cards, they are not used during the game.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> Setup is the same for 2, 3 or 4 players.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Each game of Sagrada is played over 10 rounds.</p>\n\n<p>Each round, the Start Player (the player with the Dice Bag) pulls dice out of the Dice Bag at random and rolls them. The number of dice pulled depends on the number of players (2 per player, plus 1 additional die):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 Players - 5 Dice</li>\n<li>3 Players - 7 Dice</li>\n<li>4 Players - 9 Dice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once rolled, these dice form the Draft Pool.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with the Start Player, each player takes a turn in clockwise order. On a player's turn, they may perform each of the following actions in any order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Select 1 die</b> from the Draft Pool and place it in an open space on their Window</li>\n<li><b>Use 1 Tool Card</b> by spending Favor Tokens</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each action is optional - A player may choose to perform both actions, only one action or pass their turn taking no actions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>Turns proceed <b>clockwise</b> with each player taking a turn or passing.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example:</b> Emily takes a turn <s class=\"tokenlabel3\">1</s>, then Ben <s class=\"tokenlabel3\">2</s>, then Mari <s class=\"tokenlabel3\">3</s>.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/sagrada/example.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Once the last player has completed their first turn, the round continues in reverse order (counterclockwise).</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with the last player, each player takes a second turn (selecting a second die from the Draft Pool, etc).</p>\n\n<p><b>Example:</b> Mari takes her second turn <s class=\"tokenlabel3\">4</s>, then Ben <s class=\"tokenlabel3\">5</s>, then Emily <s class=\"tokenlabel3\">6</s> Once the Start Player has taken their second turn, proceed to the End of the Round.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Placing Dice</h2>\n\n<p>When placing a die on a Window:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"white\">\n\n<p><b>First die:</b> Each player's first die of the game must be placed on an edge or corner space.</p>\n\n<p><b>Every other die</b> must be adjacent to a previously placed die, touching diagonally (different row and column) or orthogonally (same row or column).</p>\n\n<p>The die must match the color or value restriction of the space. White spaces have no restrictions Example - A red space on the window may only be filled by a red die (any value). A space showing a 3 may only be filled by a die showing a 3 (any color).</p>\n\n<p>Dice may never be placed orthogonally adjacent to a die of the same color or the same value. Example - Two red dice or two dice showing a 3 may not be placed side by side.</p>\n\n<p>Players may choose not to draft a die during their turn.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> Any die may be placed on a white space as long as all the above restrictions are obeyed</p>\n\n<p><b>Tip:</b> Try to avoid placing dice next to a matching space (such as a 2 die next to a 2 space or red die next to a red space) so a future die can still be placed in that space</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tool Cards &amp; Favor Tokens</h2>\n\n<p>Players may spend Favor Tokens to gain a special ability from 1 Tool Card during their turn:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Place Favor Tokens on the Tool Card - 1 if there aren't any tokens on the card, otherwise place 2.</li>\n<li>Use the ability listed on the Tool Card.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Players may choose not to use a <b>Tool Card</b> on their turn.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/sagrada/cardstokens.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><b>Tip:</b> Being the first to use each Tool Card costs the fewest Favor Tokens. However, Tool Card abilities become more useful later in the game as player's Windows fill with dice.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End Of The Round</h2>\n\n<p>All remaining dice are placed on the <b>Round Track</b>, covering the number space for the just completed round. If multiple dice remain (due to players skipping a draft action) these do not cover additional number spaces.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/sagrada/end_of_round.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The <b>Dice Bag</b> is passed clockwise to the next player. This player is now the Start Player - players then begin another round.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example </b>- Ben is now the start player for the second round.</p>\n\n<p>If this was the end of the 10th round, it is the end of the game - proceed to End Game Scoring.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends at the end of the 10th round.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clear the dice off the <b>Round Track</b> and flip it over to the <b>Score Track</b> side.</li>\n<li>Use each player's <b>Score Marker</b> to track their position on the Score Track, flipping the marker if they exceed 50 points.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/sagrada/end_game_scoring.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Each player tallies their Victory Point total, gaining points from:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n<ul>\n<li><b>Each Public Objective Card </b>- Players may gain points from each card multiple times. Row/Column-based objectives only score for completed Rows/Columns (no open spaces).</li>\n<li><b>Their Private Objective Card </b>- Summing the values of their dice of the specified color.</li>\n<li><b>Favor Tokens </b>- 1 Victory Point for each unspent token.</li>\n<li>Players <b>Lose 1 Victory Point</b> for each open space on their window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The player with the highest Victory Point total is the winner.</p>\n\n<p>Ties are broken by most points from Private Objectives, most remaining Favor Tokens, then finally by reverse player order in the final round.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Dice Placement Mistakes</h3>\n\n<p>If a Player's Window is ever found to break any of the placement restrictions, that player must immediately remove dice (of their choice) from their Window until all restrictions are obeyed. These dice are out of play and any resulting open spaces will count against their score as normal.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"the-great-facades-passion.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Over that time, they have mesmerized marine life and created amazing aquatic ecosystems. Prepare yourselves to do the same... and open your eyes to the beauty of the oceans.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>112 coral pieces (28 pieces of each color)</li>\n<li>88 point tokens</li>\n<li>60 cards</li>\n<li>4 player cards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>Collect the most points by cleverly acquiring and playing cards that let you grow your reef and score its patterns.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef3.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Sort the 112 coral pieces by color to form 4 separate supplies <s class=\"tokenlabel\">A</s>. Depending on the number of players, each of these 4 supplies must comprise a certain number ofcoral pieces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In a 4-player game: Use all 28 coral pieces of each color.</li>\n<li>In a 3-player game: Use 24 coral pieces of each color.</li>\n<li>In a 2-player game: Use 18 coral pieces of each color.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return any unused coral pieces to the box. Sort the point tokens by their value (I, 3, 5,10,20) and form separate supplies for each value <s class=\"tokenlabel\">B</s></p>\n\n<p>Give each player three l-point token <s class=\"tokenlabel\">C</s>, which he places in front of him as his personal point stock. This is where he collects all of his point tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Shuffle the 60 cards and deal 2 cards face down to each player <s class=\"tokenlabel\">D</s>. Each player takes his cards into his hand, concealing them from the other players. Then set the card deck face down aside for later.</p>\n\n<p>Take as many player boards <s class=\"tokenlabel\">E</s> as there are players. Make sure the one with the starfish <s class=\"tokenlabel\">F</s> is included. Shuffle them and place one at random in front of each player. The player with the starfish board will be the first player.</p>\n\n<p>From the coral supplies, each player takes 1 coral piece of each color <s class=\"tokenlabel\">G</s>. Then each player places one of his 4 coral pieces onto each of the 4 center spaces of his player board <s class=\"tokenlabel\">H</s> (in any order).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef7.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If all players know the game, we recommend the following setup variant: Each player places his 4 pieces on any spaces of his player board other than the 4 central spaces. He may even stack them up any way he likes.</p>\n\n<p>Next to his player board, each player should leave some room for a face-up discard pile <s class=\"tokenlabel\">I</s>. Take the deck of cards set aside earlier and place it as a face-up draw deck <s class=\"tokenlabel\">J</s> in the middle of the table.</p>\n\n<p>Draw 3 cards from that deck and place them in a face-up row next to the deck. That row of 3 cards forms the card display <s class=\"tokenlabel\">K</s>.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Reef is played over a series of rounds. Each player will take one turn each round, starting with the first player and going clockwise until the game end is reached. On your turn, you must perform one of the following two actions:</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li>Take a card from the card display (or from the deck) into your hand.</li>\n<li>Play a card from your hand to grow your reef AND (if possible) score a pattern</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Then it is the turn of the player to your left.</p>\n\n<h3>A. Take a card from the card display (or from the deck) into your hand</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef8.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Choose one of the 3 cards from the display and put it in your hand. If there are any point tokens on that card, place them in your personal point stock.</p>\n\n<p>Then bring the display back up to 3 cards by moving the top card from the deck to the display.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef9.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Instead of taking one of the 3 cards in the display, you may take the top card from the face-up draw deck and put it in your hand. However, to do so, you must immediately place one l-point token from your personal point stock onto the card with the lowest printed point value (the number in the bottom right corner) in the display.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a tie for the lowest printed point value, place it onto the tied card of your choice. If your personal point stock is empty, you cannot take the top card from the draw deck.</p>\n\n<p><b>Attention:</b> You have a hand limit of 4 cards. If you already have 4 cards in your hand, you cannot take another card. You must perform action B instead.</p>\n\n<h3>B. Play a card from your hand to grow your reef and (if possible) score a pattern</h3>\n\n<p>Play a card from your hand by placing it onto your face-up discard pile, next to your player board. Then perform the two following steps in this specific order:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef13.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>1. From the supplies of their respective colors, take both coral pieces shown on the top of your played card and place each of them anywhere on your player board: Each can be on any blank space or on top of a piece or stack.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef14.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You are free to stack these two pieces in any order onto one another or place them separately. However, once you have placed them, they remain where they are for the rest of the game.</p>\n\n<p><b>Attention:</b> There is a stack limit: If a stack already contains 4 coral pieces, you are not allowed to place another piece on top of it.</p>\n\n<p>2. Afterwards, you may score the pattern shown on the bottom of the card. To do so, check how often the pattern appears throughout your reef:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the pattern does not appear at all throughout your reef, nothing happens.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the pattern appears once in your reef, take from the points supply the number of points shown in the bottom right corner of the card and place them in your personal point stock.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the pattern appears multiple times throughout your reef, take the shown number of points as many times as the pattern appears.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To determine if and how often the pattern appears in your reef, bear the following rules in mind:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>Patterns can appear in any right-angle orientation.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef15.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<h4>Only The Topview Is Relevant!</h4>\n\n<p>This means that it is always the color of the top coral piece of any stack that counts for the pattern, no matter what color any of the pieces below it are.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef16.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>This also means that if a pattern on a card shows pieces with no printed numbers within them, your top pieces' heights do not matter when completing that pattern.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef17.jpg\"> Printed numbers, however, relate to specific heights:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef22.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef23.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>So for a pattern with a printed number, only your top pieces of the right color and height count.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>If a pattern shows printed numbers with a \"+\" next to them, all of your top pieces of the right color and with a height equal to or higher than the printed number count.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef18.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>If patterns show wild pieces (a 4-colored shape) with printed numbers, only the height of those top pieces is relevant, not their color.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef19.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<p>Each of your top pieces can only count towards one completion of the pattern. Therefore, to have a pattern appear multiple times throughout your reef, each of its completions cannot share any pieces.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef20.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"radius\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef24.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>There are 8 cards that show a special pattern like this one.</p>\n\n<p>All of them have different color combinations but basically work the same.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the pattern on the right means: Take 2 points for each purple top piece that is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to your highest coral stack with a yellow top piece.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/reef/reef21.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If there is a tie for the highest, choose one of them. (It does not matter how high any of the stacks of other colors are - including the purple ones - as long as there is no higher stack with a yellow top piece).</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>As soon as at least one color of coral pieces runs out, the game will end after players finish out the current round of play.</p>\n\n<p>In rare cases, the game also ends immediately if the card deck runs out.</p>\n\n<p>Each player who still has any cards left in his hand may now score the patterns of those cards (without taking any coral pieces first). However, for each card a player still has in his hand, that player may only score a completed pattern once, even if the pattern appears multiple times throughout his reef.</p>\n\n<p>Once this is done, the player with the highest score wins the game.</p>\n\n<p>In case of a tie, the tied player who has the most covered spaces on his player board wins. If this does not breakthe tie, the tied player who has the most stacks of 4 corals wins. If this still does not breakthe tie, the victory is shared.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>General Notes</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>puring the last round, when you must take coral pieces of a color whose supply does not contain enough pieces, take as many as you can from that supply and continue your turn as usual.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>&amp;t any time, you may exchange point tokens between your personal point stock and the points supplies (or between a card in the display and the point supplies) to get different denominations of the same value.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>During the game, you are allowed to stack your point tokens to conceal your actual point total.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The supply of point tokens is considered unlimited. If you run out of tokens,</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"buy-reef.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

You must explore all the lands, wheat fields, lakes, mountains in order to spot the best plots. But be careful, as some other Lords are also coveting theses lands...</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> Before your first game, assemble the 4 small castles.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/kingdomino/components.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>4 starting tiles</li>\n<li>4 3D castles</li>\n<li>48 dominoes</li>\n<li>8 wooden kings in 4 colors</li>\n<li>Instructions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box blue2_border\">\n\n<p>Connect your dominoes in order to build your kingdom in a 5x5 grid in a way to score the most prestige points.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/kingdomino/setup.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Place the box as indicated to the right. Each player takes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2-player games: two kings of their color.</li>\n<li>3- and 4-player games: one king of their color.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each player takes a starting tile (a square) and the castle of their color. They place the tile, face up, in front of them and then they place the castle on it.</p>\n\n<p>ALL the dominoes are thoroughly shuffled, numbered side up, and then they are randomly placed in the box insert to form the draw pile of the game:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 player games: first, remove 24 dominoes randomly, set them aside. Use the remaining 24.</li>\n<li>3 player games: remove 12 dominoes randomly. Play with remaining 36.</li>\n<li>4 player games: use all 48 dominoes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">A</s> Then, from the draw pile, take the same number of dominoes as the number of kings in play (i.e. three dominoes for a 3-player game and four dominoes for a 2- or 4-player game). Display them next to the box, numbered side up. These dominoes must be displayed in the ascending order (the lowest number next is always placed next to the box). Finally, turn them on the lands- cape side.</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">B</s> A player takes all the kings in their hands, shuffle them thoroughly and then they get them out of their hands one after the other. When your king appears, place-it on an empty domino in the line. Each tile can only have one king. It means that the last player doesn't have any choice. (in a 2-player game, each player will choose 2 dominoes, one for each of their kings)</p>\n\n<p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">C</s> When all the dominoes have been chosen, form a new line, as you previously did, by drawing new tiles.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/kingdomino/setup2.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The playing order is determined by the positions of the kings on the dominoes line.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/kingdomino/gameplay.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The player, whose king, is placed on the 1st domino of the line (the closest to the box) starts. He must take the following actions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">D</s> 1 : Add the chosen domino to their territory according the connection rules.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><s class=\"tokenlabel\">D</s> 2: Choose a new domino in the new line by placing their king on it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then, it is the turn of the player whose king is on the second domino to take their two actions, and so on, until the last player has taken their two actions.</p>\n\n<p>In a 2-player game, each player will take the <s class=\"tokenlabel\">D</s> 1 and <s class=\"tokenlabel\">D</s> 2 actions twice, once for each of their kings.</p>\n\n<p>Then, form a new dominoes line and a new turn can start.</p>\n\n<p>The game is played in 12 turns in 3- or 4-player games, and only 6 turns in 2-player games (as each player plays twice each turn).</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Connection Rules</h3>\n\n<p>The players must build a kingdom in a 5x5 grid (each domino is composed of two squares).</p>\n\n<p>In order to place down their domino, the player must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Either connect it to their starting tile (the starting domino can be considered as a wild domino, any landscape can be connected to this domino),</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Or connect it to another domino matching at least 1 of its landscape (horizontally or vertically only).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you can't add a domino to your kingdom fol- lowing these rules, the domino must be discarded and you will not get points for it.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/kingdomino/gameplay2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>All your dominoes must fit in 5x5 grid. If, due to bad planning, one or more of your dominoes could not fit, they are discarded. You will not get points for them.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box blue2_border\">\n\n<p>When the last dominoes are lined up, the players will take a last turn but they will only take the <s class=\"tokenlabel\">D</s> 1 action.</p>\n\n<p>Each player should have in front of them a 5x5 grid forming their kingdom. (some kingdoms may not be complete if a player was forced to discard any dominoes - see above). Then, each player will calculate their prestige points for their kingdoms in the following way:</p>\n\n<p>A kingdom is composed of different properties (groups of connected, either horizontally or vertically, squares of the same type of landscape).</p>\n\n<p>Each property will give you as much prestige points as the NUMBER OF SQUARES multiplied with the number OF specific crowns appearing on the property.</p>\n\n<p>You can have multiple properties with the same type of landscape in the same kingdom. ZA property without a specific crowns will give you no points.</p>\n\n<p>Each player will add the points given by all their properties, the result is their final score. The player with the highest score is the winner.</p>\n\n<p>In case of a tie, the player with the most extended property (whether he owns any crowns or not) wins the game.</p>\n\n<p>If it is still a tie, the player who has the most crowns wins the game. If there is still a tie anyway, the players share the victory.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/kingdomino/victory.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Additionnal Rules</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box grey5_bg\">\n\n<p><b>Dynasty:</b> Play 3 rounds in a row. At the end of the 3 rounds, the player with the highest number of points wins the game.</p>\n\n<p><b>The middle Kingdom:</b> score 10 additional points if your castle is in the center of your kingdom.</p>\n\n<p><b>Harmony :</b> score 5 additional points if you territory is complete (no discarded dominoes).</p>\n\n<p><b>The Mighty Duel:</b> With 2 players. After one or two practice games, the real champions battle to build the largest kingdoms: use all the dominoes to build a 7x7 grid (a pen and paper might be useful to keep your final score).</p>\n\n<p>You can mix these different variants if you want according to what you prefer.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"age of giants.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

At some point during the game, one player triggers what is called the haunt.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, one player usually becomes a traitor bent on defeating the rest of the players. The rest of the players become heroes struggling to survive. From then on, the game is a fight between the traitor and the heroes-often to the death.</p>\n\n<p>Each game will change the house in some way and tell more of its story. At the end of 13 chapters (plus a prologue), you will complete the campaign portion of Betrayal Legacy. From there, you may play the game in \"free play\" mode. In free play, very few changes will be made to the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/components.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n<ul>\n<li>1 sealed box and 1 sealed envelope</li>\n<li>2 haunt books</li>\n<li>1 Bleak Journal</li>\n<li>1 sticker sheet</li>\n<li>1 Folium Infernum</li>\n<li>12 tiles (including 4 starting tiles)</li>\n<li>1 numbered track</li>\n<li>5 plastic family figures</li>\n<li>5 colored plastic bases</li>\n<li>5 Family cards</li>\n<li>20 plastic clips</li>\n<li>8 dice</li>\n<li>7 Item cards</li>\n<li>11 Event cards</li>\n<li>1 Traitor card</li>\n<li>1 Monster card</li>\n<li>2 Legacy decks</li>\n<li>1 Purgatory deck</li>\n<li>20 tile planks</li>\n<li>122 tokens</li>\n<li>1 rulebook</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>Explore the house and make your family member stronger until the haunt begins. After that, your goal is to complete your side's victory condition first, as either a traitor or a hero.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>What is a Legacy Game?</h2>\n\n<p>Betrayal Legacy is a legacy game, so some things that happen in one game will carry forward to future games. Sometimes you will add cards or add stickers to materials.</p>\n\n<p>Other times you may destroy components or otherwise permanently alter the game. Each group's journey and history of the house will be unique. Which families will have a penchant for madness? Which tiles will become focuses of evil?</p>\n\n<h4>How Does Betrayal Legacy Work?</h4>\n\n<p>The campaign is played over a series of chapters, each one a different game. Each chapter, players will play a member of a family. It may be the character who played in the previous chapter (if they lived) or a descendant-perhaps a nephew or child or lost cousin.</p>\n\n<p>Each game is self-contained: it starts mostly the same way and proceeds until there is a winning side. At the end of the game, players will follow instructions to shape the start of the next game (and games beyond that).</p>\n\n<p>Along the way, the house and its environs will change, sometimes outside the players' control.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>Key Terms</h5>\n\n<p>Everyone: Each player, monster, or other inhabitant of the house.</p>\n\n<p>Figure: The plastic pawn controlled by a player. People/Person: Anyone in the house who isn't a monster.</p>\n\n<p>Traitor: Any player who has turned evil after the haunt has started. Traitors are still players.</p>\n\n<p>Hero: Any player who remains good after the haunt has started. Heroes are still players.</p>\n\n<p>Monster: Large or small Monster tokens during a haunt.</p>\n\n<p>Item/Omen/Object: Things that are carried by players. Items and Omens are cards.</p>\n\n<p>Objects appear in some haunts and are represented by tokens.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Elements</h2>\n\n<p>Read here <a href=\"game-elements.php\">all detailed information of the game elements</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>Attach four plastic clips to your character's Family card. Each one should point to one of the starting values for their Speed, Might, Sanity, and Knowledge. The starting values are colored green.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Find the four starting tiles. Place them reasonably far apart on the table to create regions of the house and its environs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game22.jpg\"><br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Select a figure to represent you and place it into a base matching the color of your Family card.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><i>(Campaign only)</i> Privately give your character a first name and an age, and write both on the back of your Family card. (You can make up any age you like). This will likely be a new character, but if you survived the previous chapter, you may use the same character again, now older.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<i>\n\n</i><p><i>(Campaign only)</i> Introduce yourself to the rest of the players, stating your character's name and age.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><i>(Campaign only)</i> Read the top card in the Legacy deck.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p><i>(Free play only)</i> Shuffle all card decks separately. Shuffle the tiles to make a stack.

Each player will play a member of the same family in each game. At the start of each chapter, write the name of your family member on the card, as well as their age.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of each campaign game, record their fate (such as \"Vanquished a demon!\" or \"Died near a well from poison\"), whether they died, and whether they were a traitor.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game5.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Traits, Dice and Tiles</h2>\n\n<h3>Traits</h3>\n\n<p>Each character has four traits, shown on their Family card: Speed, Might, Sanity, and Knowledge. Speed and Might are physical traits; Sanity and Knowledge are mental traits. Character traits are public knowledge.</p>\n\n<h3>Damage, Gaining, Losing, And Healing</h3>\n\n<p>Characters can take damage, causing their traits to decrease. Slide the corresponding clips down the track a total number of steps equal to the damage, divided as you choose. The type of damage determines which traits can be lowered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Physical Damage:</b> Lower Might and/or Speed.</li>\n<li><b>Mental Damage:</b> Lower Knowledge and/or Sanity.</li>\n<li><b>General Damage:</b> Lower any combination of traits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may also be instructed to lose from or lower a specific trait directly (such as \"Lose 2 Speed\"). That counts as taking physical or mental damage, depending on the trait.</p>\n\n<p>If you take \"1 die of damage\", roll a die and take appropriate damage equal to the result.</p>\n\n<p>If more than one person and/or monster would take damage at the same time, start with the player to the left of the current player and proceeed clockwise.</p>\n\n<p>If you are instructed to gain X in a trait, you may increase that trait X steps (up to its highest step). If you are instructed to heal a trait, you may return that trait to its starting value if it is lower. Do nothing if it is equal to or higher than its starting value.</p>\n\n<h3>Critical Traits</h3>\n\n<p>When a trait is at its lowest step before the skull, it is critical. Before the haunt begins, no trait can drop below its critical value (if it would, it stays at the critical value instead). Once the haunt begins, traits can drop to the skull. If that happens, you die.</p>\n\n<h3>Raising and Lowering from the same Effect</h3>\n\n<p>Many effects in the game require you to lose from a trait in order to gain a benefit. You must be able to pay the full \"penalty\" in order to gain the \"reward\". If you can't, you do not get the benefit. For example, a tile's effect might say \"If you end your turn here, you may lose 2 Might to gain 1 Sanity\". If your Might is 1 step above critical, you cannot lose 2 Might, so you cannot gain 1 Sanity.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Dice and Die Rolls</h2>\n\n<p>There are 8 dice that come with the game. Each die has faces with 0, 1, or 2 dots. When you make a roll, total the number of dots to get the result. You can never roll more than 8 dice and you can never roll fewer than 1 die.</p>\n\n<p>No result can ever be below 0, no matter how many penalties are applied. Then do what the effect says for that result.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game23.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game24.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Trait Rolls</h3>\n\n<p>You will often be told to make a trait roll based on one of your family's traits (for example, \"Make a Might roll\"). When that happens, roll dice equal to the number you currently have in that trait.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you must make a Sanity roll, and you currently have a Sanity of 4, roll 4 dice and total the dots together to get the result. The card's or tile's text will tell you the outcome.</p>\n\n<h3>Roll X Dice</h3>\n\n<p>Some effects require you to roll a certain number of dice. Pretty straightforward; just roll that many dice and add up the dots. These are not trait rolls and are not subject to anything that affects trait rolls.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Regions and tiles</h2>\n\n<p>The house and its environs have four regions: outside, basement, ground floor, and upper floor. Each region is separate from the others. As the house grows, you might start running out of table space. In that case, adjust the tiles as needed to make more space. Do not change how the tiles are connected; move each region as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Tiles are adjacent if they are both discovered and connected by a doorway or other effect. \"Doorway\" is used regardless of whether the tile is inside or outside. A doorway that is not connected to another tile is an open doorway.</p>\n\n<p>The Ground Floor Staircase is adjacent to the Upper Landing and the Basement Landing (and vice versa). The Front Steps tile, which is in the outside region, is adjacent to the Entrance Hall (and vice versa).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>At the start of your turn, do the following in order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Set any used Items and Omens you are carrying to unused.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Gain moves equal to your current Speed.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Take your turn, using moves and taking actions as you like until you are out of both or choose not to do any more. You can perform actions in between moves, after you are out of moves, or before moving.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Moving</h3>\n\n<p>Moves are used most often to travel to an adjacent tile or to discover a new tile. You use 1 move for each tile you leave. No matter how many penalties you have on a turn or how many obstacles you face, you can always move to a tile adjacent to where you started.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game7.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><b>Obstacles:</b> Each small obstacle on a tile costs 1 extra move when leaving that tile.</p>\n\n<p>Each large obstacle on a tile costs 2 extra moves when leaving that tile. Also, Small Monster tokens are small obstacles and Large Monster tokens are large obstacles to the heroes.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you draw a card from the Event, Omen, or Item deck for any reason, you lose any remaining moves you had. You can still take actions.</p>\n\n<h4>Secret Passages</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game6.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The house has secret passages within it. In the prologue, there is one tile with a secret passage (the Crawlspace). As you play, you will find ways to place Secret Passage stickers on tiles.</p>\n\n<p>A tile with a secret passage is adjacent to every other tile with a secret passage.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game9.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Discovering a new Tile</h3>\n\n<p>When you leave a tile through a doorway not connected to a tile, look at the back of the top tile of the stack. If it has the name of the region you are in (some tiles can go into more than one region), turn it over and connect it by aligning a doorway on the new tile to the doorway you just passed through. Then move into that tile. You have discovered it.</p>\n\n<p>Add each new tile as logically as you can, connecting as many adjacent doorways as you can. Two tiles (the Entrance Hall and Front Steps) have a bump on one side to show that tiles cannot be placed on those sides.</p>\n\n<p>If the top tile can't go on the region you're currently on, bury it. Keep burying tiles until you find one that matches your region.</p>\n\n<p>Most tiles have a symbol on their face-up side, representing an Event, Item, or Omen. When you first discover a tile with one of these symbols, draw a card with the matching symbol. (Tiles with these symbols are called Event tiles, Item tiles, and Omen tiles). Some tiles also have an action on them.</p>\n\n<p>Some tiles have more than one symbol. When discovering such a tile, resolve each symbol from left to right. Players cannot take any actions before or between resolving these symbols.</p>\n\n<p>Players who enter a previously discovered tile do not draw a card when they enter but still are affected by text on the tile and can take any action printed on the tile.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game12.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Runestones</h4>\n\n<p>Some tiles contain Runestone symbols. You can ignore these unless a card or haunt tells you otherwise.</p>\n\n<h4>Ghosts</h4>\n\n<p>Most tiles have circles on them showing where ghosts will come to haunt the house. Some tiles start with ghosts on them. Omens harness the energy of ghosts in the house and are more powerful on tiles with ghosts. Some Event cards will be more painful on tiles with ghosts.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game25.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Turn Timing when Discovering a Tile</h4>\n\n<p>You might be required to do multiple things when discovering a tile. Resolve them in the following order.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>Resolve any symbol(s) from left to right, one at a time. You cannot take any actions while resolving Event cards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>If you drew an Omen card and the haunt hasn't started, check to see if the haunt starts. If the haunt starts, your turn is immediately over. Do not resolve any other symbols or effects on the tile. Otherwise, your turn contintues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>You may take any action(s) printed on the tile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Resolve any text that says \"If you end your turn on this tile . . \". If there are multiple \"end of turn\" effects on a tile, you may resolve them in any order you like.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Infrequent Tile Rules</h4>\n\n<h5>Discovering multiple tiles in a turn</h5>\n\n<p>If you are ever forced to discover a new tile due to a game effect, you draw a card and follow any other text on the tile as if you had discovered it the traditional way. This is true even if you already discovered a tile (and drew a card) this turn.</p>\n\n<h5>False Features</h5>\n\n<p>If it's impossible to match up all doorways, you instead create a false feature (perhaps a closet or thicket). You can't move through these false features.</p>\n\n<h5>No more tiles for that region</h5>\n\n<p>If you try to discover a new tile but have run out of tiles for that region, you do not spend a move since you did not enter a new tile. You may continue your turn as if you didn't just try to walk into a closet. Or thicket.</p>\n\n<h5>Don't Seal Off a Region</h5>\n\n<p>You can't place a tile so that it seals off a region, leaving no unconnected doorways. If the only possible placement of a tile would seal off a region, bury it and draw tiles until you find one that leaves a free doorway. In the unlikely event that all the remaining tiles for a region would seal off the region, rearrange the region until there is are least one unconnected doorway.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/decks.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Cards</h3>\n\n<p>Read here <a href=\"cards.php\">all detailed information about cards</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n\n<p>Read here <a href=\"actions.php\">all detailed information about actions</a>.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The Haunt</h2>\n\n<h4>Making A Haunt Roll</h4>\n\n<p>Before the haunt starts, each time you draw an Omen card, you might trigger the haunt.</p>\n\n<p>When you discover an Omen tile and draw an Omen card, most of the time you will make a haunt roll (in campaign mode, there may be another way to trigger the haunt, explained by the Legacy deck). To make a haunt roll, roll dice equal to the number of discovered Omen cards (including the one you just drew, any carried by other players, and any that have been dropped onto tiles). During the campaign, look at the PAUSE card to see what result causes the haunt to start.</p>\n\n<p>The player who starts the haunt is the haunt revealer. After the haunt starts, if you discover a tile with an Omen symbol, you still draw and keep an Omen card, but you don't make a haunt roll.</p>\n\n<h3>Starting The Haunt</h3>\n\n<p>Haunts are usually found in two books: Secrets of Survival (the heroes' book) and the Traitor's Tome (the traitor's book). Some are found only in one book or another (and you will be told when this happens).</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time a haunt has two teams: heroes and a traitor. Both sides read the same haunt number in their books to learn the rules for that haunt. If a haunt's rules and the regular rules conflict, use the rules in the haunt.</p>\n\n<p>If two or more people could be the traitor, draw a random Crest token from tied families to determine the traitor.</p>\n\n<h4>Variable Player Count {3p/4p/5p}</h4>\n\n<p>Most haunts have different target numbers depending on the number of players. For example, you may need to kill more Rats in the five-player game than the three-player game. Whenever you see braces with three numbers, such as {1/5/7}, this tells you the number you need depending on how many players are in the game. In this case, 1 is for the three-player game, 5 is for the four-player game, and 7 is for the five-player game.</p>\n\n<h4>Public Information</h4>\n\n<p>At the start of each haunt (in both books) are two pieces of information that all sides should hear (the heroes and traitor should hear this starting information in the other book).</p>\n\n<p>First, thematic entries tell you the story of what is happening. The last italicized paragraph starts \"I/ We know this/these things to be true:\" followed by one to three statements. These are hints about what the other side is up to. They may be vague, but they are true.</p>\n\n<p><b>Setup:</b> You might have to put tokens on certain tiles, or adjust traits, or find a tile that hasn't been placed yet. If there's nothing for your side to do, this part will say \"None!\" Players should do setup together so everyone can see what is being put into play.</p>\n\n<h4>Splitting Up</h4>\n\n<p>At this point, the groups usually split up. When the haunt starts, one side (heroes or traitor) should take their book and leave the room, far enough away so neither team can hear each other. The traitor usually learns their haunt alone. It's lonely being evil. But often a good time!</p>\n\n<h4>Learning The Haunt</h4>\n\n<p>After splitting up, each side should read how to win, then all the goals needed to win, listed (where possible) in the order you should complete them.</p>\n\n<p>For example, here's how that looks in Haunt 0 in Secrets of Survival. This is an example haunt to show you how haunts are formatted. It contains no spoilers.</p>\n\n<p>You Win When You Banish The Bride.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You may Find the Bride's Diary.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You may Read the Diary to improve your chances of banishing her.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Banish the Bride to bring her final rest.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Next, facts about the haunt are listed: special rules or other important details that your side needs to know, rather than do.</p>\n\n<h4>Resuming Play</h4>\n\n<p>When both sides are ready, all players return to the room and take their turns in the following order.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The hero to the left of the traitor takes the first turn.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Play continues to the left, with the traitor going after all heroes have gone.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If there is a monster in the haunt, the monster takes a turn after the traitor. (The haunt will tell you where to put the Monster card to remind everyone when the monster takes a turn).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In haunts where there is no traitor (or the traitor starts hidden or unknown), the haunt will tell you who goes first.</p>\n\n<p>Other than the time when the heroes and traitor separate to learn the haunts, everyone must converse only where everyone at the table can hear them; they can't leave and have side conversations elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h4>Moving Past Opponents</h4>\n\n<p>After the haunt starts, opponents act as small obstacles. Heroes are opponents to the traitor and monsters, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<h4>Hidden Information</h4>\n\n<p>Other than what is read aloud at the start of the haunt, all information in the other book is private at the start of the haunt. However, if you don't understand how a goal, reaction, or power works, it is better to ask the other side before doing it so that everyone can agree on the rule. Springing surprises is fun, but it is a tiny issue to reveal information early and get agreement from all players.</p>\n\n<p>Also, when you take an action in a box, the other side can ask you to read the entire text. For example, if a side goal had you make a roll to find a piece of a sacred tablet, once you made that roll, the other side could ask you to read the entire side goal box. When the monster first attacks, the other side may ask about its traits, and so on. You don't have to ask about the other side-some people like to be surprised as they play.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>So You're Evil Now</h3>\n\n<p>When you become a traitor, you get a wonderful little benefits package, which is summed up on the Traitor card. Traitors will be instructed to take this card at the start of the haunt as a reminder.</p>\n\n<p>As the traitor, you gain these abilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You ignore Obstacle tokens (heroes still count as obstacles).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You don't take damage from tile effects.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When taking an action on a tile, you may use a result of 5 instead of making a trait roll.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When you discover an Event tile, you may choose not to draw an Event card (and continue moving if you have moves left). If you draw an Event card, you must resolve it as normal.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You may ignore harmful effects from Ongoing Event cards. If you do so, you do not benefit from any positive effects from those cards.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You are immune to any negative ghost effects on Event cards.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The haunt will state any additional things you can and can't do.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game31.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Hidden Traitor</h4>\n\n<p>Some haunts feature a hidden traitor, whose identity is secret from the other players. The haunt will tell you how the traitor is determined. Haunts with hidden traitors do not appear in the Traitor's Tome. Instead, the goals and abilities of the traitor are described under the haunt in Secrets of Survival, which everyone reads.</p>\n\n<h5>The Traitor</h5>\n\n<p>Gray boxes show up in haunts with a hidden or unknown traitor. This information is public, but only relevant to the traitor.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Monsters</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game33.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Monsters behave differently than players. They take a turn when play reaches the Monster card. Usually this is after the traitor's turn. In rare cases, the monster still takes a turn even if it's dead. The haunt will note this.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monster Abilities:</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Monsters make a Speed roll at the start of their turn to determine their moves (minimum of 1). This applies to all monsters of the same type.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Monsters don't take damage from tile effects.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Monsters can't discover new tiles.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Monsters may use special movement on cards or tiles (the traitor chooses the result if there is a die roll) unless it would allow them to discover a new tile.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Monsters can't carry or STEAL Items, Omens, or Objects.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Monsters don't take actions (including ATTACK) except for what the haunt says they can take.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The haunt will state any additional things monsters can and can't do.</p>\n\n<p>Most monsters can't be killed. If a monster would take damage, it is stunned instead. Flip its token over to the stunned side. A stunned monster's entire next turn is spent getting unstunned. The only thing it does is flip its token back to the unstunned side. Skip all text in the monster box for a stunned monster, even mandatory reaction text. Stunned monsters aren't obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>Small Monster tokens are numbered from 1 to 20. Small monsters always take their turns in number order from lowest to highest.</p>\n\n<p>Each monster moves and takes all its actions before the next one goes, unless the haunt says otherwise. (Some act as a swarm, moving all at once and then attacking as a group).</p>\n\n<p>Monsters act as obstacles depending on their size. Small monsters are small obstacles (they cost 1 extra move to leave) and large monsters are large obstacles (2 extra moves to leave).</p>\n\n<p>If a monster is allowed to carry Items, Omens, or Objects and is stunned, it drops anything it carried. The monster can't pick them up again until it starts a turn unstunned.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Dying</h3>\n\n<p>Once the haunt begins, if any of your traits moves to the skull, then you die. Tip over your figure on your tile. DROP all your Items, Omens, and Objects. You are now a corpse.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the traitor dies, as long as the monsters can complete the haunt's goals, the monsters still get their turn (under the traitor's control) and the traitor can still win.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/betrayal-legacy/game21.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The first side to complete its goals for the haunt wins the game.</p>\n\n<h3>During The Campaign</h3>\n\n<p>There are three steps you will take at the end of a game during the campaign.</p>\n\n<h4>1. Read Chapter Ending</h4>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, haunts will direct you to the chapter ending in the Bleak Journal to read more of the story. Use the entry for the side that won the haunt. For example, haunt 72 might tell you to go to entry 800 if the heroes win or entry 666 if the traitor wins. Make sure you go to the correct entry in the Bleak Journal.</p>\n\n<p>The chapter ending will continue the story and tell you which cards from the Purgatory deck to add or intensify (see page 11). There also may be other effects at the end of a chapter.</p>\n\n<h4>2. Record your Fate</h4>\n\n<p>Write down the fate of your character. This has no game effect and is purely for your narrative amusement. Have fun with it.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Return Cards</h4>\n\n<p>Return any cards that were put into the box back to their respective decks.</p>\n\n<h4>4. Record the history of the house</h4>\n\n<p>The back of the Traitor's Tome has three pages where you may record any interesting moments from this chapter so that the history of your house is never forgotten. This has no game effect.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Joining the campaign</h4>\n\n<p>You do not have to use the same number of families, or even the same families, for each chapter. You could have the blue, green, and red families in one chapter and then the blue, green, yellow, and purple families in another.</p>\n\n<p>If a family has missed MORE than half of the played chapters, give them three random Items after step 7 of setup and have them keep one. Shuffle the other two back into the Item deck.</p>\n\n<p>The player may heirloom this item if it has a slot available, following usual heirloom rules, except this does NOT count toward the once-per-game limit on making heirlooms.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote class=\"white\">\n\n<h5>What if we can't figure out a rule?</h5>\n\n<p>Betrayal games mix effects on cards, haunts, rules, and tiles to create interesting combinations. We have tried to make it easy to understand how all these different effects might work together.</p>\n\n<p>However, the nature of the game means that you will inevitably find combinations that create uncertainty. In addition, legacy games create higher stakes since some effects are permanent. Here are a few guidelines when faced with uncertainty:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Rules in haunts trump other rules.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Rules on cards or tiles trump rules in the rulebook.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you find a single card, rule, or effect that gives you a wildly powerful moment, that probably isn't its intention.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you find a combination of several cards, rules, and effects that give you an advantage, that probably is the intention.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If an effect seems wildly unfair, that is not the correct interpretation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although it is a game of murder, insanity, horror, and other savagery, be mindful of other players' experiences as well. Arguing about rules loopholes isn't horror, it's horrific.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"game-elements.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Set the food and fuel dials to \"8\", the morale dial to \"10\", and the population dial to \"12\".</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Set Up Tokens and Ships:</b> Place the eight vipers and four raptors in the \"Viper and Raptor Reserves\" space of the game board. Then place the fleet token on the start space of the Jump Preparation track. Last, place all other tokens (facedown) and plastic ships adjacent to the game board.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Determine First Player:</b> Randomly choose a player to be the first player, and give him the current player token. This player will choose his character first and take the first turn of the game.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Choose and Place Characters:</b> Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses a character of the character type(s) that is most plentiful (political leader, military leader, or pilot). This restriction does not apply to support characters, who may be chosen at any time.</p> <p>After choosing a character, the player receives the corresponding character sheet and stand-up character token, as well as a piloting token if applicable. He then places his character token on the location specified on his character sheet.</p> <p>Example: The first player chooses Laura Roslin (a political leader) as his character. The next player may choose any military leader or pilot (since they are the most plentiful). He could also choose a support character.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Distribute Title Cards:</b> The President title is given to the first available player in the following list: Laura Roslin, Tom Zarek, and Gaius Baltar. The Admiral title is given to the first available player in the following list: William Adama, Saul Tigh, and Helo Agathon. The Admiral is then given the two nuke tokens, and the President shuffles the Quorum deck and draws one Quorum Card.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Set Up Loyalty Deck:</b> Set up the Loyalty deck according to the \"Creating the Loyalty Deck\" sidebar.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Set Up Other Cards:</b> Shuffle the Quorum deck, Crisis deck, Super Crisis deck, and Destination deck and then place them next to the game board. Then separate the Skill Cards into five decks by type, as shown on their faces. Shuffle each deck separately, and then place them (facedown) below the matching colored regions at the bottom of the game board. Lastly, place the Kobol Objective Card faceup next to the Destination deck.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Receive Skills:</b> Each player, except the starting player, draws a total of three Skill Cards from among any of the cards he can draw during his Receive Skills step. The starting player does not receive Skill Cards now, but will draw Skill Cards at the start of his turn.</p></li>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/setup-ships.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<li><p><b>Create Destiny Deck:</b> Deal two Skill Cards of each skill type facedown onto the \"Destiny deck\" space on the game board and shuffle them thoroughly.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Set Up Ships:</b> Place one basestar and three raiders in front of Galactica. Then place two vipers below Galactica and two civilian ships behind Galactica (as shown right).</p>\n\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The object of the game for a given player depends on which team he belongs to. A player's team is determined by the Loyalty Cards he receives throughout the game.</p>\n\n<p>All human players win the game if they travel at least eight units of distance (as specified by the Kobol Objective Card) and then jump one final time.</p>\n\n<p>All Cylon players win the game by preventing the humans from reaching their objective. They usually accomplish this goal by running the fleet out of a resource (food, fuel, morale, or population), but can also win by destroying Galactica or successfully invading Galactica with centurion boarding parties.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p><i>Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game</i> is played over a number of game turns. Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, players take complete game turns in order until either the human or Cylon players have won the game. Each game turn consists of the following steps, carried out in order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p><b>Receive Skills Step:</b> The current player draws the number and types of Skill Cards listed on his character sheet.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>2. Movement Step:</b> The current player may move to a different location. If he moves to a different ship (from Galactica to Colonial One or vice versa), he must discard one Skill Card from his hand.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Action Step:</b> The current player chooses one action to perform. Options include the actions listed on his location, character sheet, and Skill Cards.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Crisis Step:</b> The top card of the Crisis deck is drawn and then resolved.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Activate Cylon Ships Step</b> (if necessary): If any are in play, Cylon ships are activated according to the Crisis Card drawn.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Prepare for Jump Step</b> (if necessary): If the Crisis Card has the \"prepare for jump\" icon on it, the fleet token advances one space up the Jump Preparation track. If the token reaches the end of this track, then the fleet jumps.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>After the Prepare for Jump step, the current player's turn is over, and he hands the current player token clockwise to the player on his left. This player then begins his turn starting with the Receive Skills step.</p>\n\n<h3>Receive Skills Step</h3>\n\n<p>During this step, the current player draws Skill Cards according to the skill set listed on his character sheet. The player always draws the cards listed on his character sheet regardless of the number of cards already in his hand.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/william-skill-set.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Example: It is William Adama's Receive Skills step. He looks at his skill set, which lists 3 leadership and 2 tactics. He therefore draws three leadership Skill Cards and two tactics cards.</p>\n\n<p>Some character sheets list multi-colored skills known as multi-skills. When a character with a multi-skill receives Skill Cards, he must first decide how many cards he will draw from each type. The total number of cards that he draws must be equal to the number listed on his sheet.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/multi-skill.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Example: It is the start of Lee \"Apollo\" Adama's turn. He therefore draws two piloting and one tactics Skill Cards according to the skill set listed on his character sheet. He may then decide to draw two leadership or two politics Skill Cards - or one of each - since he has a 2 leadership/politics multi-skill.</p>\n\n<h3>Movement Step</h3>\n\n<p>During this step, the current player may move his character token to another location if he wishes. If he moves to a different ship, he must discard one Skill Card from his hand. Human characters may not move to Cylon locations, and revealed Cylons may only move to Cylon locations.</p>\n\n<p>Example: It is Lee \"Apollo\" Adama's movement step, and he wishes to move from \"Command\" (on Galactica) to the \"Press Room\" (on Colonial One). He discards a piloting Skill Card from his hand and moves to the \"Press Room\" location.</p>\n\n<p>If the player's character is piloting a viper, he may move to an adjacent space area during this step, or may discard a Skill Card to move to a location on Galactica or Colonial One and return his viper to the \"Reserves\".</p>\n\n<h3>Action Step</h3>\n\n<p>During this step, the current player chooses one action to perform. The action types are listed below, and are usually identified by the word \"Action:\" followed by an ability.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><b>Activate Location:</b> The player may perform the action listed on his character's current location.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Skill Card Action:</b> The player may play a Skill Card from his hand to perform the action specified on the card. Note that not all Skill Cards have actions on them.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Character Action:</b> The player may perform an action listed on his character sheet. Note that only some character sheets have actions listed on them.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Activate his Viper:</b> If the player is piloting a viper, he may activate it to move or to attack a Cylon ship.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Title and Quorum Cards:</b> If the player has a Title or Quorum Card that provides him with an action, then he may perform it during this step.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Loyalty Card:</b> The character may reveal one of his \"You are a Cylon\" Loyalty Cards to perform the specified action on it. He then follows the rules for revealed Cylon players.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Do Nothing:</b> If the player does not wish to perform any actions, he may decide to do nothing during this step and proceed to the Crisis step.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Crisis Step</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/cyclonattackcrisis.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>During this step, the current player draws the top card of the Crisis deck, reads it aloud, and then resolves it. There are three types of Crisis Cards: Cylon attacks, skill checks, and events.</p>\n\n<h4>Cylon Attack Crises</h4>\n\n<p>These Crisis Cards feature an image of Galactica and some surrounding ships. When resolving a Cylon attack Crisis Card, simply follow the steps listed on it. Then discard the card unless instructed to keep the card in play.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/skillcheckcrisis.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Skill Check Crises</h4>\n\n<p>These Crisis Cards list a difficulty and one or more skill types, listed as colored boxes, in the upper left corner. These cards are resolved according to the rules for skill checks and have outcomes based on whether the players pass or fail the skill check. Some of these cards give the current player, the President, or the Admiral the choice to either resolve the skill check or carry out some alternate instruction.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/eventcrisis.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Event Crises</h4>\n\n<p>Any Crisis Card that is not a Cylon attack or skill check is an event. These crises have instructions that must be immediately followed. Some of them provide a decision for the current player, the President, or the Admiral.</p>\n\n<h3>Activate Cylon Ships Step</h3>\n\n<p>If there is at least one Cylon ship in play, then the Cylon ships may move or attack based on the icon on the bottom left of the Crisis Card.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/bottomcrisis.jpg\"><br>\n\n<h3>Prepare for Jump Step</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/jumpicon.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If the drawn Crisis Card has the \"prepare for jump\" icon on its lower right corner, then the fleet token moves one space ahead (toward the \"Auto Jump\" space) on the Jump Preparation track.</p>\n\n<p>If this causes the token to move to the \"Auto Jump\" space, then the fleet jumps to a new destination.</p>\n\n<p>After this step, the current player's turn is over. He discards any Crisis Cards drawn this turn, and hands the current player token to the player on his left, who begins his turn (starting with the Receive Skills step).</p>\n\n<h3>Losing Resources</h3>\n\n<p>The four resources (fuel, food, morale, and population) are all vital to the survival of humanity. These resources are usually lost due to Crisis Cards, civilian ships being destroyed, or Galactica damage tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Crisis cards list resource loss as text, for example \"-1 population\", while tokens list resource loss as a number of red icons. For example, one red population icon means the same as \"-1 population\". The list of resource icons is found below as well as on the game board.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/resources.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Whenever a resource is lost for any reason, the appropriate resource dial is adjusted to represent the new total. The red color on the resource wheels tells players when a resource is half (or less) full, and is used by sympathizer Loyalty Cards.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n\n<p>Each player takes on the role of a character from the Battlestar Galactica universe. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses as listed on his character sheet.</p>\n\n<p>The following information can be found on each character sheet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><b>Character Type:</b> Each character has a type listed on his character sheet. This type only matters during setup, and exists to help players choose a well-rounded group of characters.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Character Abilities:</b> Each character has two positive abilities and one negative ability. Some of these abilities are passive (always affecting the character) while others require the player to use them as an action.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Skill Set:</b> Each character sheet lists the skills the character has expertise in. At the start of the player's turn, he gains the number and types of Skill Cards listed in his character's skill set. When a character is allowed to draw Skill Cards of an unspecified type, they must be from within his skill set unless specified otherwise.</p> <p>Example: William Adama is in the \"Research Lab\" and uses the action listed there to draw one tactics or one engineering card. He may choose to draw engineering even though it is outside his skill set, because the location specifies the card type.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Setup:</b> Each character has setup instructions on his card. This usually lists the location where the character is placed at the beginning of the game. Some characters have special instructions (such as \"Apollo\", whose sheet instructs the player to launch a viper and place him in it as a pilot).</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each character is represented by a stand-up character token, which is used to track his location on the game board. After the character tokens are punched out, each one is attached to a plastic character stand.</p>\n\n<h2>Character Sheets</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/charactersheets.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<ol>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Character Type (Political Leader, Military Leader, Pilot, or Support)</li>\n<li>Positive Abilities</li>\n<li>Negative Ability</li>\n<li>Setup Location</li>\n<li>Skill Set</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Title Cards</h2>\n\n<p>Title and Quorum Cards provide powerful abilities to the player who controls them. Title Cards are assigned at the beginning of the game, but may change hands through the use of certain locations or because of cetain Crisis Cards. In addition to the abilities listed below, the President and Admiral are given many important decisions to make by Crisis Cards.</p>\n\n<h3>The President and Quorum Cards</h3>\n\n<p>The President starts the game with one Quorum Card in his hand and can draw more using the President Title Card, or \"President's Office\" location. These cards provide special actions that only the President can perform and provide him a wide range of powerful abilities.</p> <p>Whichever player has the President title has control over this hand of Quorum Cards. These cards are kept secret, and there is no limit to the number of cards that may be in the President's hand.</p>\n\n<h3>The Admiral</h3>\n\n<p>The Admiral has two important abilities. First off, he starts the game with two nuke tokens. These tokens can be devastatingly effective against basestars, but are an extremely limited resource.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the Admiral is the player who decides which destination the fleet travels to when jumping (see \"Jumping the Fleet\" on the following page). This decision can be extremely beneficial or harmful to the human players.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Line of Succession</h2>\n\n<p>Should the President or Admiral be revealed as a Cylon, the next player in the line of succession for that title claims it. In addition, if the Admiral (but not the President) is placed in the \"Brig\", then the next player in line claims the Admiral title. If an Admiral stripped of his title later moves out of the \"Brig\", he does not automatically reclaim the title.</p>\n\n<p>The orders of succession are:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/characters.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Admiral</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li>William Adama</li>\n<li>Saul Tigh</li>\n<li>Helo Agathon</li>\n<li>Lee \"Apollo\" Adama</li>\n<li>Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace</li>\n<li>Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii</li>\n<li>Galen Tyrol</li>\n<li>Tom Zarek</li>\n<li>Gaius Baltar</li>\n<li>Laura Roslin</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h4>President</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Laura Roslin</li>\n<li>Gaius Baltar</li>\n<li>Tom Zarek</li>\n<li>Lee \"Apollo\" Adama</li>\n<li>William Adama</li>\n<li>Karl \"Helo\" Agathon</li>\n<li>Galen Tyrol</li>\n<li>Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii</li>\n<li>Saul Tigh</li>\n<li>Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Note that if the President is in the \"Brig\", he keeps the President title and all associated abilities.</p>\n\n<h2>Component Limitations</h2>\n\n<p>Whenever a deck of cards runs out, the current player shuffles the appropriate discard pile to form a new deck. This includes Skill Cards, Quorum Cards, Crisis Cards, Super Crisis Cards, and Destination Cards.</p>\n\n<p>Tokens and plastic ships are limited to the quantity provided, and can run out during the game. The current player always decides the order in which a component type is placed, and if there are not enough, he decides which ones are not placed.</p>\n\n<p>Example: A Cylon attack Crisis Card is drawn that requires two basestars to be placed on the game board. There is already one basestar on the game board, so there is only one more that can be placed. The current player decides which of the two basestars listed on the Cylon attack card to place on the game board.</p>\n\n<p>If all vipers are already in play and a player wishes to activate the \"Hangar Deck\" location, he may choose to move a viper from any space area to the \"Reserves\" so that he may pilot it.</p>\n\n<h2>Adjusting Difficulty</h2>\n\n<p>Some play groups may find that it is too easy for the human or Cylon players to win the game. A group may decide before the start of the game to make the game easier for the humans or Cylons.</p>\n\n<p>To make the game easier for the human players, start the game with 2 more of each resource (10 food, 10 fuel, 12 morale, and 14 population).</p>\n\n<p>To make the game easier for the Cylons, start the game with 2 less of each resource.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/battlestar-galactica/box.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h2>End of the game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends when all human players travel eight units of distance and then jump one file time. The human players won the game in this case, else the Cyclon players won.</p>\n\n<p>When the Galactica gets destroyed or being successfully invaded, then the game is also over and the humans lost the game.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"human-players.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Learn and play the Basic Game several times before venturing into the Advanced Game.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h2>Basic Game</h2>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>Each faction has a set of unique economic, military, strategic, or treacherous advantages. The object of the game is to use these advantages to gain control of Dune. The winner is the First Player to occupy at least 3 strongholds with at least one of their forces during the Mentat Pause Phase.</p>\n\n<p>A player may win alone or in an Alliance with other players.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Place all spice tokens in the Spice Bank.</p>\n\n<p>The Spice Deck and Treachery Deck are shuffled and placed face down next to the game board. Played cards will be piled face up next to the decks as discards and reshuffled to restock the Spice Deck and Treachery Deck as necessary.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/map.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Players now choose factions.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of ways for players to choose their faction.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<p>Use the faction cards from the Prediction Deck to randomly determine what faction each player will play. Shuffle the cards and deal 1 card to each player, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>Each player randomly draws a card from the Bene Gesserit turn prediction cards and selects a faction in the order of their drawn card, with the highest card choosing first.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Players may swap factions with each other at this point if they wish.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>Two &amp; Three Player Games</h5>\n\n<p>For a three player game, recommended factions are Atreides, Harkonnen, and Fremen. In a three player game an Alliance needs 4 strongholds to win, as in the standard Alliance rules.</p>\n\n<p>For a two player game, try Atreides vs Harkonnen, or play 2 factions each (select factions normally as described above). In a two player game, the number of strongholds needed to win is increased to 4.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h5>Four &amp; Five Player Games</h5>\n\n<p>For 4 player, consider leaving out both the Spacing Guild and Bene Gesserit, while for 5 player games try playing with no Bene Gesserit.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Players take their Player Shields and player sheets and set up their factions as follows:</p>\n\n<h5>1. Positions</h5>\n\n<p>Players place their Player Marker on the player circle closest to their shield and seat at the table.</p>\n\n<h5>2. Traitors</h5>\n\n<p>Remove the cards for all factions that are not in play from the Traitor Deck. Then shuffle the cards thoroughly. Each player is dealt 4 cards</p>\n\n<p>Each player then secretly selects 1 card to keep. If a player draws any leaders from an opponent's faction, they can choose 1 leader to become their traitor. If they drew no opponent leaders, they can protect one of their own leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, each player places their chosen card face down behind their shield, returning the other cards face down to the bottom of the Traitor Deck.</p>\n\n<h5>3. Spice</h5>\n\n<p>Spice equal to the amount indicated on each player sheet is removed from the Spice Bank and placed behind each shield.</p>\n\n<h5>4. Forces</h5>\n\n<p>Each player's forces are placed on the board as indicated by their player sheet. All forces in reserve are placed next to your shield.</p>\n\n<h5>5. Treachery</h5>\n\n<p>1 card from the Treachery Deck is dealt to each player.</p>\n\n<h5>6. Turn Marker</h5>\n\n<p>Place the turn marker at 1 on the Turn Track.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> A faction has special advantages that may contradict the rules. A faction's particular advantages always have precedence over the rules.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>DUNE is played in turns to a maximum limit of 10 turns.</p>\n\n<p>Each turn is composed of nine specific phases that must be completed in the exact sequence presented below.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game37.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>1. Storm Phase</h5>\n\n<p>The Storm Marker is moved around the map. The faction whose Player Marker the storm next approaches will be the First Player for this turn.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game38.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>2. Spice Blow and Nexus Phase</h5>\n\n<p>The top card of the Spice Deck is turned over and the amount of spice shown on the card is placed in the highlighted territory. If Shai-Hulud appears during the Spice Blow Phase, a Nexus occurs and the players have the opportunity to make and break Alliances.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game39.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>3. Choam Charity Phase</h5>\n\n<p>Players with 0 or 1 spice may claim CHOAM Charity.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game40.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>4. Bidding Phase</h5>\n\n<p>Players bid spice to acquire Treachery Cards.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game37_.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>5. Revival Phase</h5>\n\n<p>All players are allowed to reclaim forces and leaders from the Tleilaxu Tanks.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game38_.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>6. shipment and Movement phase</h5>\n\n<p>Starting with the First Player and proceeding counterclockwise, each player in turn ships forces down to the planet or brings in forces from the southern hemisphere (Fremen) and then moves their forces on the game board.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game39_.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>7. Battle Phase</h5>\n\n<p>Players must resolve battles in every territory that is occupied by forces from two or more factions.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game40_.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>8. Spice Harvest Phase</h5>\n\n<p>Forces in territories that contain spice may collect the spice.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game36_.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<h5>9. Mentat Pause Phase</h5>\n\n<p>Factions either declare a winner (or winners) or take some time to evaluate their positions on the map and then move the Turn Counter to the next position on the Turn Track to begin the next turn.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game36.jpg\"> Phase 1: Storm</h2>\n\n<h4>First Storm</h4>\n\n<p>The first time the storm is moved, the Storm Marker is placed at a random location along the map edge using the following procedure. The two players whose player circles are nearest on either side of the Storm Start Sector will secretly dial a number from 0 to 20 on the wheels.</p>\n\n<p>The two numbers are simultaneously revealed, totaled and the Storm Marker moved from the Storm Start sector counterclockwise around the map for the sum total of sectors.</p>\n\n<h4>Storm Movement</h4>\n\n<p>In all subsequent Storm Phases, the two players who last used the Battle Wheels will independently dial a number from 1 to 3, simultaneously reveal their numbers, add them together, and then advance the Storm Marker from its current position counterclockwise around the map for the sum total of sectors.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game31.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h4>Damage</h4>\n\n<p>Any forces in a sector of sand territory (except the Imperial Basin) over which the storm passes or stops are killed. Place these forces in the Tleilaxu Tanks. Forces that are not on a sand territory find protection from the storm. In addition any spice in a sector over which a storm passes or stops is removed to the Spice Bank.</p>\n\n<h4>Obstruction</h4>\n\n<p>Forces may not move into, out of, or through a sector in storm. Forces may not battle if either force is in storm.</p>\n\n<h4>First Player</h4>\n\n<p>The player whose Player Marker the storm next approaches is the First Player in the Bidding Phase, Shipping Phase, and Movement Phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game43.jpg\"> Phase 2: Spice Blow and Nexus</h2>\n\n<h4>Top Card</h4>\n\n<p>The top card of the Spice Deck is turned over.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>First Turn</h5>\n\n<p>During the first turns Spice Blow Phase only, all sandworm cards turned over are ignored and set aside, then reshuffled back into the Spice Deck after this phase.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<table class=\"image-description floatr\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game41.jpg\"><br>Territory Card</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\n<h4>Territory</h4>\n\n<p>This is a Spice Blow. The amount of spice indicated on the card is taken from the Spice Bank and placed onto the territory in the sector containing the Spice Blow icon.</p>\n\n<p>Then this card is placed face up on the Spice Deck discard pile. (If the Spice Blow icon is currently in storm, no spice is placed that turn).</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Shai-hulud</h4>\n\n<table class=\"image-description floatr\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game42.jpg\"><br>Shai-Hulud Card</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\n<p>A Nexus will occur after the following events:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>All spice and forces in the territory shown on the card now face up in the discard pile are removed to the Spice Bank and Tleilaxu Tanks respectively. Then the Shai-Hulud card is placed face up on the Spice Deck discard pile.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Then another card is turned over. If it is a Shai-Hulud it is immediately discarded and another card is turned over. This continues until a Territory Card appears and spice is placed as defined above. The Territory Card is placed face up on the Spice Deck discard pile.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Nexus</h4>\n\n<p>Revealing a Shai-Hulud card after the first turn also causes a Nexus at the end of the phase. In a Nexus, Alliances can be formed and broken.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game46_.jpg\"> Phase 3: Choam Charity</h2>\n\n<p>Any player with 0 or 1 spice can collect spice to bring their total to 2 by calling out \"CHOAM Charity\".</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game44.jpg\"> Phase 4: Bidding</h2>\n\n<h4>Declaration</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game72.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Before bidding starts, all players must declare how many Treachery Cards they hold. The hand limit is 4. Players with 4 cards must pass during bidding.</p>\n\n<h4>Dealer</h4>\n\n<p>One of the players deals cards from the Treachery Deck face down in a row, 1 card for each player who is allowed to bid.</p>\n\n<h4>Auction</h4>\n\n<p>The first card in the row is now auctioned off for spice.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The bidding is started by the First Player. If that player already has 4 Treachery Cards the next player to the right who does not have 4 Treachery Cards opens the bidding.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The player who bids first must bid 1 or more spice or pass. Bidding then proceeds to the bidder's immediate right. The next bidder may raise the bid or pass and so on around the table until a top bid is made and all other players pass. The top bidding player then pays the number of spice they bid into the Spice Bank and takes the card.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Bid Limit</h4>\n\n<p>Players may not bid more spice than they have.</p>\n\n<h4>Next Starting Bidder</h4>\n\n<p>In subsequent bidding during this phase, the First Player who can bid, to the right of the player who opened the bid for the previous card, begins the bidding for the next card. In this way every player who can bid gets a chance to open the bidding for a Treachery Card.</p>\n\n<h4>End Of Bidding</h4>\n\n<p>Bidding for Treachery Cards continues until all cards available for bid have been auctioned off or a card is not bid on by anyone. If a card is passed on by everyone, all remaining cards are returned to the top of the Treachery Deck and the Bidding Phase is over.</p>\n\n<h4>Transparency</h4>\n\n<p>The number (not the type) of Treachery Cards each player holds must always be open to everyone during the Bidding Phase. No one is allowed to hide the number of cards that they hold. A player can never have more than 4 cards in their hand at any one time. If they have a full hand, they must pass on all cards up for bid.</p>\n\n<h4>Time Limit</h4>\n\n<p>Each player must bid within 10 seconds of the previous player or they are assumed to have passed.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game46.jpg\"> Phase 5: Revival</h2>\n\n<h3>A. Force Revival</h3>\n\n<p>All players may now revive up to 3 forces from the Tleilaxu Tanks.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><b>Free:</b> A certain number of forces are revived for free as stated on the player sheet.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>By Spice:</b> Any additional forces that may be revived must be done at a cost of 2 spice per force. All spice expended for force revival is placed in the Spice Bank.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Limit:</b> A player can never revive more than 3 forces per turn.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>To Reserves:</b> Revived forces must be placed in the player's reserve.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>B. Leader Revival</h3>\n\n<p>If all 5 of a player's leaders are in the Tleilaxu Tanks they may revive 1 leader per turn until all of their leaders have been revived.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><b>Fighting Strength:</b> To revive a leader, a player must pay that leader's fighting strength in spice to the Spice Bank.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Revived Leader Status:</b> A revived leader can be played normally and is still subject to being a traitor.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Dead Again:</b> If a revived leader is killed again, place it face down in the Tleilaxu Tanks. This leader cannot be revived again until all of the player's other revivable leaders have been revived, killed, and sent to the Tleilaxu Tanks again.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game45.jpg\"> Phase 6: Shipment and Movement</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/shipment.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The First Player conducts their Force Shipment and then Force Movement. Play then proceeds to the right until all players have completed this phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Force Shipment</h3>\n\n<h4>Shipment of Reserves</h4>\n\n<p>A player with off-planet reserves may make one shipment of any number of forces from their reserves to any one territory on the map.</p>\n\n<h4>Payment</h4>\n\n<p>A player must pay spice to the Spice Bank for their shipment. The cost of shipping off-planet reserves is 1 spice per force shipped into any stronghold and 2 spice per force shipped into any other territory.</p>\n\n<h4>Sectors</h4>\n\n<p>When shipping into a territory lying in several sectors, a player must make clear in which sector of the territory they choose to leave their forces.</p>\n\n<h4>Exceptions</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><b>Storm:</b> No player may ship into a sector in storm.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Strongholds:</b> No player may ship into a stronghold already occupied by two other players.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>One Way:</b> No player may ship forces from the board back to their reserves.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Force Movement</h3>\n\n<p>Each player may move, as a group, any number of their forces from one territory into one other territory. Forces are free to move into, out of, or through any territory occupied by any number of forces with certain restrictions and additional movement advantage mentioned below.</p>\n\n<h4>Ornithopters</h4>\n\n<p>A player who starts a force move with one or more forces in either Arrakeen, Carthag, or both has access to ornithopters and may move forces through up to three adjacent territories.</p>\n\n<p>The forces moved do not have to be in Arrakeen or Carthag to make the three territory move. Thus, for example, a player with one or more forces in Arrakeen would be able to move forces starting in Tuek's Sietch through Pasty Mesa and Shield Wall to the Imperial Basin, where they must stop.</p>\n\n<h4>One Adjacent Territory</h4>\n\n<p>A player without a force in either Arrakeen or Carthag at the start of their move does not have access to ornithopters and can only move their forces by foot to one adjacent territory.</p>\n\n<h4>One Force Move</h4>\n\n<p>Each player may make only one force move per turn.</p>\n\n<h4>Sectors</h4>\n\n<p>Sectors have no effect on movement. Forces can move into or through a territory ignoring all sectors. A sector's only function is to regulate the movement and coverage of the storm and spice collection.</p>\n\n<h4>Storm</h4>\n\n<p>As defined above in the Storm Phase section, no force may move into, out of, or through a sector in storm. Many territories occupy several sectors, so that a player may move into and out of a territory that is partly in the storm, so long as the group does not pass through the part covered by the storm.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When ending a move in a territory lying in several sectors, a player must make clear in which sector of the territory they choose to leave their forces.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The Polar Sink is never in storm.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Stronghold Blocking</h4>\n\n<p>Like shipment, forces cannot be moved into or through a stronghold if forces of two other players are already there.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game44_.jpg\"> Phase 7: Battles</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/battle.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>I. Battle Determination</h3>\n\n<p>Wherever two or more players' forces occupy the same territory, battles must occur between those players.</p>\n\n<p>Battles continue until just one player's forces or no forces remain in all territories on the map with two exceptions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Players cannot battle one another in a territory if their forces are separated by a sector in storm. Their forces can remain in the same territory at the end of the phase.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Players cannot battle in the Polar Sink. It is a free haven for everyone.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>First Player</h4>\n\n<p>When resolving battles, the First Player is named the aggressor until all of their battles, if any, have been fought. The aggressor chooses the order in which they wish to fight their battles. Then the player to their immediate right becomes the aggressor and so on, until all battles are resolved.</p>\n\n<p>If three or more players are in the same territory, the aggressor picks who they will battle first, second, etc. for as long as they survive.</p>\n\n<table class=\"image-description\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/troops.jpg\"><br>Troop Tokens</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>II. Battle Plan</h3>\n\n<p>To resolve a battle, each player must secretly formulate a Battle Plan. A Battle Plan always includes the number of forces dialed on the Battle Wheel. If possible, it must include a faction's leader or cheap hero. It may include Treachery Cards at the player's discretion.</p>\n\n<h4>Battle Wheel</h4>\n\n<p>Each player picks up a Battle Wheel and secretly dials a number from zero to the number of forces they have in the disputed territory. Both players will lose the number of forces dialed on the Battle Wheel.</p>\n\n<h4>Leaders</h4>\n\n<p>One Leader Disc is selected and placed face up in the slot on the wheel. A Cheap Hero Card may be played in lieu of a Leader Disc.</p>\n\n<table class=\"image-description\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/leaders.jpg\"><br>Leader Tokens</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<p>Leaders that survive battles may fight more than once in a single territory if needed, but no leader may fight in more than one territory during the same phase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>A player must always play either a leader or a cheap hero card as part of their Battle Plan if possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>If it is not possible, they must announce that fact.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h5>No Treachery</h5>\n\n<p>A player with no leader or cheap hero must still battle, but they cannot play any Treachery Cards as part of their Battle Plan. (This situation can occur when a player does not have a cheap hero and all their leaders are in the Tleilaxu Tanks or have fought in another territory in that phase).</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<p>When a player plays a cheap hero, their total is simply the number of tokens on the dial, but the option to play weapon, defense, or worthless cards is still available to them.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game47.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Treachery Cards</h4>\n\n<p>Players with a leader or cheap hero may play a Weapon Treachery Card, Defense Treachery Card, or both by holding them against the wheel. They may play no Treachery Cards as well.</p>\n\n<h4>Revealing Wheels</h4>\n\n<p>When both players are ready, the Battle Plans are revealed simultaneously.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>III. Battle Resolution</h3>\n\n<h4>Winner</h4>\n\n<p>The winner is the player with the higher total of number dialed on the Battle Wheel, plus their leader's fighting strength.</p>\n\n<h4>No Ties</h4>\n\n<p>In the case of a tie, the aggressor has won.</p>\n\n<h4>Weapons</h4>\n\n<p>If a player's opponent played a Weapon Treachery Card and the player did not play the proper Defense Treachery Card, the player's leader is killed and cannot count toward their total. Both leaders can be killed and neither count in the battle. When a player plays a cheap hero, their total is simply the number of forces they dial, but they can play weapons or other Treachery Cards.</p>\n\n<h4>Killed Leaders</h4>\n\n<p>Any leaders killed are immediately placed face up in the Tleilaxu Tanks. The winner immediately receives their value (including their own leader, if killed) in spice from the Spice Bank.</p>\n\n<h4>Surviving Leaders</h4>\n\n<p>Leaders who survive remain in the territory where they were used until all battles in other territories have been resolved. Then they are retrieved by their owners.</p>\n\n<h4>Losing</h4>\n\n<p>The losing player loses all the forces they had in the territory to the Tleilaxu Tanks and must discard every Treachery Card they used in their Battle Plan. Note that the loser does not lose their leader as a result of battle. Leaders are killed only by Weapon Treachery Cards.</p>\n\n<h4>Winning</h4>\n\n<p>The winning player loses only the number of forces they dialed on the Battle Wheel. These forces are placed in the Tleilaxu Tanks. The winning player may also keep or discard any of the cards they played.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h3>Traitors</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/traitor.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If you are in a battle and your opponent uses a leader that matches a Treachery Card you control, you may call out \"Treachery!\" and pause the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p><b>The Traitor Card is revealed.</b></p>\n\n<p>The player who revealed the traitor card:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>immediately wins the battle</li>\n<li>loses nothing, regardless of what was played in the Battle Plans (even if a lasgun and shield are revealed)</li>\n<li>places the traitorous leader in the Tleilaxu Tanks and receives the traitorous leader's fighting strength in spice from the Spice Bank.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>The Player Whose Traitor Was Revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loses all of their forces in the territory</li>\n<li>discards all of the cards they played</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<p><b>Two Traitors</b></p>\n\n<p>If both leaders are traitors, each a traitor for the opponent, both players' forces in the territory, their cards played, and their leaders, are lost. Neither player gets any spice.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game45_.jpg\"> Phase 8: Spice Collection</h2>\n\n<p>Any player with forces in a sector of a territory in which there is spice may now collect that spice. This is done by taking the spice tokens you are entitled to from the territory and placing them behind your shield.</p>\n\n<p>The collection rate is 3 spice per force if the player occupies Carthag or Arrakeen. It is 2 spice per force if the player does not occupy Carthag or Arrakeen.</p>\n\n<p>Uncollected spice remains where it is for future turns.</p>\n\n<table class=\"image-description\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/spice.jpg\"><br>Spice Tokens</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/game43_.jpg\"> Phase 9: Mentat Pause Phase</h2>\n\n<p>If one player occupies 3 strongholds with at least one of their forces during the Mentat Pause Phase, that <b>player wins the game</b>.</p>\n\n<p>If the required number of strongholds is 4 and the two players in an Alliance separately occupy a total of at least 4 strongholds with one or more forces at the end of a turn, that <b>Alliance wins the game</b>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if the Atreides are in an Alliance with the Fremen, and the Fremen occupy Sietch Tabr and Carthag and the Atreides occupy Tuek's Sietch and Arrakeen during the Mentat Pause Phase, they win the game together.</p>\n\n<p>If there are no winners, players mull over their positions on the board, consider their options and, when they are ready, move the turn marker to the next position on the Turn Track to begin the next turn.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Alliances (Nexus)</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/dune/alliance.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Once a Shai-Hulud (sandworm) card is turned over on the second or subsequent turns, at the end of the Spice Blow and NEXUS Phase, a Nexus occurs. During a Nexus, all players have a chance to make, join or break Alliances. Once players have had a chance to do so, play continues.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Forming an Alliance</h3>\n\n<h5>Basics</h5>\n\n<p>No more than two players may be in an Alliance and the win condition is now 4 instead of 3 strongholds.</p>\n\n<h5>Discussion</h5>\n\n<p>Players may discuss among themselves the advantages and disadvantages of allying, and with whom.</p>\n\n<h5>Transparency</h5>\n\n<p>The members of the Alliance must be revealed to all. Alliances cannot be secret. Swap Alliance Cards as a reminder of who are in an Alliance.</p>\n\n<h5>Limits</h5>\n\n<p>Several Alliances can be formed during a Nexus, but no player can be a member of more than one Alliance. Once all players have had a chance to ally, no further Alliances can be made until the next Nexus.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Breaking an Alliance</h3>\n\n<h5>Breaking</h5>\n\n<p>Any player may break an Alliance during a Nexus. Players just announce that they are breaking from an Alliance.</p>\n\n<h5>Joining Another</h5>\n\n<p>Players who break from an Alliance have an opportunity to immediately join or form a new Alliance.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>How an alliance functions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Winning</h5>\n\n<p>Allied players' forces are considered the same for the purposes of victory. If together their joint forces hold 4 strongholds in the Mentat Pause Phase, they have jointly won the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Constraint</h5>\n\n<p>Allies may not enter any territory (except the Polar Sink) in which one of their allies already has a force and, thus, may never battle one another.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> If for any reason two factions who became allies during the last turn occupy the same territory at the beginning of the next turn, one of those factions must move out of that territory during the Shipment and Movement Phase.</p>\n\n<p>If the first faction to ship and move does not move out of the territory, the second faction must move out or lose those forces to the Tleilaxu Tanks.</p>\n\n<p>}..</p>\n\n<h5>Ally Secrecy</h5>\n\n<p>Allies may discuss and share strategy and information secretly at any time.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Bidding</h5>\n\n<p>During the Bidding Phase, allies may help each other by paying some or all of the cost of each other's Treachery Cards so that a player can bid more spice than they actually have.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Movement</h5>\n\n<p>During the Movement Phase, allies may pay for each other's shipments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>Shared Advantages</h5>\n\n<p>Allies may assist one another as specified on their player sheets.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Secrecy</h2>\n\n<p>Players are never required to keep their cards, spice holdings, or the traitors they selected secret. They are never obligated to reveal this information either.</p>\n\n<p>All spice holdings should be kept behind the Player Shield. The number of Treachery Cards held must be kept open during the Bidding Phase, but can be kept secret at all other times.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Bribery</h2>\n\n<p>Players who are not members of the same Alliance can make any kind of verbal deals or bribes between one another. Once made, these deals and bribes must be stated aloud and must be honored. A player cannot renege on a deal or bribe. Spice can be part of the bribe or deal.</p>\n\n<p>A deal or bribe cannot involve the transfer or gift of Treachery Cards, leaders, forces, or faction advantages. This leaves secret information, future actions, and, of course, spice.</p>\n\n<p>A player cannot make a deal or bribe that would contravene the rules or the player's faction powers. These are the only limitations.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"game-elements.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Players are either Loyal Servants of Arther fighting for Goodness and honor or aligned with the Evil ways of Mordred.</p>\n\n<p>Good wins the game by successfully completing three Quests. Evil wins if three Quests end in failure. Evil can also win by assassinating Merlin at game's end or if a Quest cannot be undertaken.</p>\n\n<p>Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discussion, deception, accusation, and logical deducation are all equally important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>The Cards and Tokens</h2>\n\n<p><b>Character Cards </b>- Determine the player's loyalty. Character cards on the side of Good have Arthur's sigil on blue background and Evil have Mordred's sigil on red background.</p>\n\n<p>Hereafter references to a player's Good or Evil loyalty are denoted with a special front.</p>\n\n<p>Some characters have special powers during the game - Merlin and the Assasin are included in all games and the remaining special character cards are optional.</p>\n\n<p>A player's character card may not be revealed at any point in the game, nor the character art discussed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><b>Leader Token </b>- Designates the player that will propose the Quest Team.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Team Tokens </b>- Allocate positions on the Quest Team.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Vote Tokens </b>- Approve or reject the Leader's proposed Quest Team.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>Quest Cards </b>- Determine a Quest's success or failure.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Select the tableau corresponding to the number of players. Place the tableau in the center of the play area with the Score Markers, Team tokens, and Quest cards adjacent to the tableau.</p>\n\n<p>Place the Round markers on the tableau's 1st Quest space. Given each player a set of two vote tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Randomly select a Leader; the Leader receives the leader token. Use the chart below to determine the number of Good and Evil players.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr><th>Players</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th></tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr><td>Good</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td>Evil</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table><br><br>\n\n<p>Suffle the appropriate number of Good character cards and Evil character cards. One of the Good character cards will be the Merlin card, all the others will be just \"loyal servant of Arthur's cards).</p>\n\n<p>One of the evil character cards will be the Assassin card, all the others will be just \"minion of Mordred\" cards. Deal one card to each player face down.</p>\n\n<p>Each player secretly looks at their assigned loyalty on their character card.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Evil reveals itself and merlin looks into the future</h4>\n\n<p>True Evil is rampant in the land. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous miniona.</p>\n\n<p>The forces of Evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of Evil, but he must speak of his only in riddles.If his true identity is discovered all will be lost.</p>\n\n<p>After all the players know their loyalty, the leader must ensure that all the Evil players know each other and that Merlin knows all the Evil players by repeating the following script:</p>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow3_bg\">\n<ol>\n<li>Everyone close your eyes and extend your hand info a fist in front of you.</li>\n<li>Minions of Mordred open your eyes and look around so that you know all agents of Evil.</li>\n<li>Minions of Mordred close your eyes.</li>\n<li>All players should have their eyes closed and hands in a fist in front of them.</li>\n<li>Minions of Mordred - extend your thumb so that Merlin will know of you.</li>\n<li>Merlin, open your eyes and see the agents of evil.</li>\n<li>Minions of Mordred - put your thumbs down and re-form your hands into a fist</li>\n<li>Merlin, close your eyes.</li>\n<li>All players have their eyes closed and hands in a fist in front of them</li>\n<li>Everyone open your eyes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tutorial Video</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/WgA4GAWoQ3U?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The game consists of several rounds; each round has a team building phase and a Quest phase.</p>\n\n<p>In the team building phase the leader proposes a team to complete a Quest - all the players will either approve the proposed team and move to the quest phase, or reject the proposed team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a team is approved.</p>\n\n<p>In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the team will determine if the Quest is succesfull.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Team Building Phase</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/avalon/quests.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>It is a time for great decisions and strong leaders. Not all knights and ladies of Avalon are loyal to Arthur, and yet you must choose only those that are Good to represent him in his quests.</p>\n\n<p>If an open ear and eye is kept, Merlin's sage advice can be discerned as whispers of truth.</p>\n\n<p>Team Assignment: After appropriate discussion, the leader takes the required number of Team tokens and assigns each team token to any player.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr><th>Players</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th></tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr><td>1st Quest</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td>2nd Quest</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td>3rd Quest</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td>4th Quest</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td>5th Quest</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>The leader can be on the team, but is not required to be so. Note a player may only be assigned one team token.</p>\n\n<p>Discus, Discus, Discus. All the players should participate in helping the leader make the right choice of players to be on the team. Active and logical discusion is a great way to catch Mordred's agents in their webs of deceit.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Team Vote</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/avalon/team.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>after appropriate discussion, the leader calsl for a vote on the team assignments.</p>\n\n<p>The leader is proposing the team - but all the players have a vote in wheter they accept or reject the proposal. The leader can be evil, or one of the players chosen could be a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Don't feel that you need to accept all the proposed teams. If you reject the team then a new leader can propose a different team, maybe one without any evil players on it.</p>\n\n<p>Each player, including the leader, secretly selects one vote card. When all players have their selected vote card ready, the leader asks for the votes to be revealed. All vote tokens are flipped over so everyone can see how you voted.</p>\n\n<p>The team is approved if the majority accepts. If the team is approved, play continues in the quest phase.</p>\n\n<p>If the team is rejected (a tied vote is also rejection), the leader passes clockwise and the team building phase is repeated.</p>\n\n<p>Evil wins the game if five teams are rejected in a single round.</p>\n\n<div class=\"infobox\"><div class=\"info-icon\"><i></i></div><div class=\"infobox-body\">\n\n<p><b>Strategy tips: trust no one</b></p>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>If you aren't confident of every one on the proposed team, then you should strongly consider rejecting the proposal. Rejecting a team is not a sign that you are evil.</p>\n\n<p>A group of skilled players will usually do the vote phase three of more times before agreeing to a team. Watch who approves, and ask them why they approved - sometimes Evil players will approve because they know another evil player was included.</p>\n\n<p>Merlin can also use his voting as a signal, but be careful the evil players will be watching.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Quest Phase</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/avalon/mission.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You have debated well and wisely chosen the brave knights and ladies with whom you place your trust.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it is time to measure a person's true intent and loyalty to the noble cause for which Arthur fights. Be true and goodness will prevail.</p>\n\n<p>The leader passes a set of Quest cards to each team member. Each player on the quest selects a quest card and plays it face down in from of themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The leader collects and shuffles the played quest cards before revealing. The quest is completed successfully only if all the cards revealed are success cards. The quest fails if one fail cards have been played.</p>\n\n<div class=\" notepad\">\n\n<h4>Notes:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The good players must select the quest success card. Evil may select either the quest success or quest fail card.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The 4th quest (and only the 4th quest) in games of 7 or more players require at least two Quest failed cards to be failed Quest.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>It's suggested that two different players shuffle the played and discarded quest cards before revealing.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>it's best to designate a player not on the team to collect all the discarded Quest cards so that it's clear which cards are played and which are discarded. Shuffle the discarded quest cards.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Indicate a successful quest on the tableau by placing a blue score marker with arthur's sigil. A failed quest is shown by placing a red score marker with Mordred's sigil on the tableau.</p>\n\n<p>After the quest has been completed, advance the round marker to the next quest space on the tableau. The leader passes clockwise and the next round begins in the team building phase.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow2_border gold_bg\">\n\n<p>Arthur and Goodness prevail if the team of Good is able to successfully complete three quests without revealing Merlin's true identity.</p>\n\n<p>Mordred's dark forces of Evil win when three quests end in failure or are devious enough to force Merlin into the open.</p>\n\n<p>The game ends immediately after either 3 succesful or three failed quests. The evil players win if 3 quests fail and when 5 teams are rejected in a single round.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"box tucked_corner\">\n\n<h3>Assassinate Merlin - Evil's Last Chance</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/avalon/merlin.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/avalon/assassin.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If 3 quests are completed succesfully, the evil players will have a final opportunity to win the game by correctly naming which of the good players is Merlin.</p>\n\n<p>Without revealing any character cards, the evil players discuss and the player with the assasin character card will name one good player as Merlin.</p>\n\n<p>If the named player is Merlin, then Evil players win. If the evil players do not name Merlin, then the Good players win.</p>\n\n<p>Four additional characters with special powers are available to play. You can play with these cards in any combination that you would like.</p>\n\n<p>Different combinations will make the game harder to win for one the side of the battle or the other. It's best to add one special character card into a game at a time, adding more or changing when you are familiar with how they play. In most cases, you will want to play with Merlin, but it's not required.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Optional Character Cards</h3>\n\n<p>Click here for more <a href=\"optional-character-cards.php\">information about Percival, Mordred, Oberon and Morgana.</a></p>\n\n</div>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"optional-character-cards.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

They are never held in your hand or shuffled.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Place the two starting establishments (Wheat Field and Bakery) face up, and the four Landmarks (Station, Shopping Mall, Amusement Park, Radio Tower) face-down (Under construction) in front of each player.</p>\n\n<p>This is each player's starting town. (When playing with 3 players or less, the extra cards are not used.Group each supply establishment together and lay them out on the table so they are easy to see.</p>\n\n<p>Give 3 coins to each player. Leave the extra coins on the table where they are easy to get. (Players who earn coins from the Bank will take the coins from the table). Choose the first player to play using a suitable method.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/game7.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Players take turns in clockwise order. Players begin their turn by rolling the dice. The establishment which matches the dice roll activates its effect. (The player that owns the respective establishment earns income).</p>\n\n<p>End of their turn, the player can build one new establishment or complete one landmark. The player to complete all four landmarks first wins the game.</p>\n\n<p>When two dice are rolled, only the facilities that equal the sum of the rolls are valid.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Roll Dice</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The game progresses in turns, where each player rolls the dice.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>At the beginning, players begin their turn by rolling one die.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If the player owns a completed \"Station\" landmark, he or she can roll two dice.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(The player can select if he or she wants to roll two dice or one).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Earn Income</h2>\n\n<p>Players earn income based on the dice roll and the effects of the establishments that they own that match that roll. (Receive coins from the bank or from other players, depending on the effect of the establishment). There is no limit to the amount of coins you can hold. You can also exchange coins freely.</p>\n\n<p>There are four different timings for coin income, depending on what is written on the establishment card:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/game8.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Blue: Primary Industry.</h4>\n\n<p>Get income from the bank, during anyone's turn.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/game9.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Green: Shops, Factories, Markets.</h4>\n\n<p>Get income from the bank, during your turn only.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/game10.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Red: Restaurants.</h4>\n\n<p>Take coins from the person who rolled the dice.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/game11.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Purple: Major Establishment.</h4>\n\n<p>Get income from all other players, but during your turn only.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<br>\n<h2>Coin Transaction Between Players</h2>\n\n<p>When income and payment happens at the same time, payment is processed first.</p>\n\n<p>If the paying player cannot afford to pay the full amount, they pay what they can and the rest is exempted. (Your coin total never reaches less than zero). The receiving player is not compensated for the lost income.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Player A rolls a \"3\". Player B owns a Cafe in his town, so Player A is charged one coin. However, Player A has no coins, so he does not have to pay anything.</li>\n<li>Afterwards, Player A receives two coins from the bank for the two Bakeries in his town.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If multiple transactions take place from one dice roll, they are processed in counter-clockwise order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Player A rolls a \"3\". Player B owns 3 Cafes, and Player C owns 2 Cafes.</li>\n<li>Player B charges 3 coins and Player C charges 2 coins, but Player A only has 3 coins.</li>\n<li>Payment is processed in counter-clockwise order. Player A first pays Player C two coins. He has one coin left, which he pays Player B. The two more coins Player A owes Player B is exempted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Building New Establishments and Completing Landmarks</h2>\n\n<p>Once during his or her turn, players can build a new establishment or complete a landmark that is under construction.</p>\n\n<p>This is done by paying the coin amount written on the bottom left corner of each card to the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Only one establishment with the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/icon.jpg\"> can be built in a town (you can only build one of each <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/icon.jpg\"> establishments). Other establishments can be build multiple times in one town. (Stacking the cards vertically may be a useful way to keep track of them)</p>\n\n<p>You cannot build an establishment if the cards are sold out. When completing a landmark, turn the card face up. The landmark's effects are now active.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Shopping Mall\" effects each card. (If you have two \"Bakery\" cards then you gain 4 coins)</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/machi-koro/game.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"legacy-game-rules.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Your goal is to have the most points from your Parks, Photos, and Personal Bonus at the end of the Year.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<h5>Board &amp; Resources</h5>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game3.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Place the board in between all players. Place the two token trays to the left and right of the board where they are easily within reach of the players and return their lids to the box.</p>\n\n<p>Each tray holds all types of tokens and also Photos, forming the supply.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game4.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h5>Parks</h5>\n\n<p>Shuffle all the Park cards face down to form the Parks deck. Deal three face up into the top slots of the board and place the deck onto the Parks deck area on the top right of the board.</p>\n\n<h5>Gear</h5>\n\n<p>Shuffle all the Gear cards face down to form the Gear deck. Deal three face up into the bottom Gear slots on the board and place the deck onto the Gear deck area on the bottom right of the board.</p>\n\n<h5>Canteens</h5>\n\n<p>Shuffle the Canteen cards face down. Deal one face up to each player. This is their starting Canteen. Place the remaining Canteen deck onto its area on the top left of the board.</p>\n\n<h5>Year</h5>\n\n<p>Shuffle the Year deck. Deal two cards to each player. Players choose one of the two as their Personal Bonus for the Year and discard the other facedown.</p>\n\n<p>These cards uniquely reward a player for how well they accomplished their personal goal at the end of the game. These should re- main facedown until scored at the game's end. For your first game, just deal one to each player. Return any unused Year cards facedown to the box.</p>\n\n<h5>Seasons</h5>\n\n<p>Shuffle the Season deck. Place it onto the Season area of the board and reveal the topmost card as the first Season.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game6.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h5>Trail Setup</h5>\n\n<p>Begin creating the first Season's Trail below the board by placing the Trailhead Site tile on the far left. Separate the five Basic Site tiles (Forest, Mountain, Valley, Ocean, Vista) from the four Advanced Site tiles (Advanced Sites have an asterisk in the bottom right).</p>\n\n<p>If playing a 4-5 player game, add the Waterfall Site to the Basic Sites-if not, return it to the box. Next, shuffle the Advanced Site tiles and add one to the Basic Sites, forming the Trail deck.</p>\n\n<p>Place the remaining Advanced Sites facedown to the left of the Trailhead. Shuffle the Trail deck (the Basic Sites and one Advanced Site) and reveal one Site at a time directly to the right of the Trailhead.</p>\n\n<p>Place each additional Site to the right of the previously-placed Site until all are placed face up. Finally, place the Trail End to the right of the last Site. Make sure it is not on its SOLO side as denoted in the bottom right. The Trail for the first Season is now formed!</p>\n\n<h5>Player Colors</h5>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game7.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Give each player two Hikers of the same color and place them onto the Trailhead. Give each player a Campfire matching their Hiker color and place it on the lit side in front of them.</p>\n\n<p>Give the First Hiker Marker to the player who most recently took a hike. Give the Camera to the player to the right of the First Hiker. Return any unused Hikers and Campfires to the box.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Starting a Season</h2>\n\n<p>The four Seasons of the Year make up the four rounds of play over the course of the game. Seasons change- up gameplay each round, and the Season ends when all Hikers reach the Trail End. To begin, see how the Season will affect gameplay for the round and if any immediate action is necessary from its effect.</p>\n\n<p>Look at the Season's <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/w.jpg\"> weather pattern displayed on the bottom right of the card. Starting with the 2nd Trail Site, place the indicated tokens from the Weather Pattern onto the Trail-one per Site-from left to right. Simply repeat this pattern down the Trail and stop at the Trail End. You're ready to begin!</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game8.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Taking Turns</h2>\n\n<p>The player with the First Hiker Marker takes the first turn of the Season. On a turn, a player selects either one of their Hikers and moves the Hiker to a Site of their choice down Trail- anywhere to the right of that Hiker's current location.</p>\n\n<p>When the Hiker lands on the new Site, the player performs the Site's action. After taking the action, the next player clockwise takes a turn. Turns continue around the table until the Season ends.</p>\n\n<table class=\"image-description\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game9.jpg\"><br>The green player chooses to move their Hiker down<br>the Trail to the Wildlife Site, taking its corresponding action.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\n<p>If another Hiker-even your own-is already occupying a Site, then it cannot be visited unless you use your Campfire.</p>\n\n<p>If a Hiker is the first to land on a Site with a token from the Weather Pattern, they take it into their supply as a bonus along with taking the Site's action</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> You must be able to take a Site's action in order to visit it.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Basic Trail Sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Forest <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/f.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Take a Forest token into your supply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Mountain <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/m.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Take a Mountain token into your supply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Valley <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/v.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Take two Sunshine tokens into your supply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Ocean <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/oo.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Take two Water tokens into your supply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Vista <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/vista.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Draw a Canteen OR Turn in 2 tokens to take a Photo and gain the Camera.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Waterfall (4+) <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/waterfall.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Gain 1 Sunshine and 1 Water token (only in 4+ player games).</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Advanced Trail Sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Wildlife <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/wildlife.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Turn in any 1 token to gain a Wildlife token</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Lodge <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/lodge.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Turn in 2 tokens and gain any other 2 tokens (excluding wildlife)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Lookout <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/lookout.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Reserve or Visit a Park OR Buy a Gear card.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>River <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/river.jpg\"></h4>\n\n<p>Spend 1 water to copy the action from another site occupied by a hiker.</p>\n\n<h3>Note: trail end is not a site</h3>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Icon Reference</h2>\n\n<h4>Wildlife</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/wildlife2.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Wildlife comes in 12 different shapes and sizes, but all are simply considered wildlife. If there's any hint in the name, they're wild! They can be used in place of any other token to visit Parks or take Photos. Wildlife cannot be used in Canteens or toward buying Gear.</p>\n\n<h4>Token Symbol</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ts.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>A brown square icon denotes that any token may be used, and the number inside specifies how many.</p>\n\n<h4>Token Limit</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/limit12.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Players can carry up to 12 tokens with them. If you have more than 12 at the end of your turn, you must discard down to 12.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<h3>Canteens</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game11.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When you gain a Canteen card, place it face up in front of you on the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/gray.jpg\"> side. A Canteen can be filled with <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/o.jpg\"> on a turn to take its action.</p>\n\n<p>To fill a Canteen, place a <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/o.jpg\"> gained that turn onto the Canteen instead of into your supply and perform the Canteen's action. Note: Canteens cannot be filled with <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/o.jpg\"> that was not gained on that turn.</p>\n\n<p>You can have any number of Canteens, and any number of your Canteens can be filled on a turn if you gain multiple <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/o.jpg\">. Once a Canteen is filled, the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/o.jpg\"> remains on it until the end of the Season and cannot be used any other way.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Photos &amp; The Camera</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game12.jpg\">\n\n<p><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game13.jpg\"> Certain Year cards require a number of Photos to be taken</p>\n\n<p>To take a <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ph.jpg\"> Photo, return any two tokens of your choice to the supply when choosing the action at the Vista. Photos_are worth 1 POINT each. After taking a <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ph.jpg\"> at the Vista, gain the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ca.jpg\"> Camera from whoever currently has it.</p>\n\n<p>When you have the Camera, you're on a roll! When taking a <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ph.jpg\">, it only costs 1 token instead of 2. At the Season's end, the player with the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ca.jpg\"> may take a <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ph.jpg\"> at its reduced price. Some Gear cards give players more photo opportunities outside of the Vista, but they do not give the player the Camera.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Campfires</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game14.jpg\">\n\n<p><i>On their turn, the pink player wants to visit The Valley, but the green Hiker is already there. So, the pink player chooses to use their Campfire to share the Site and take its action.</i></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a Hiker is already at the Site you want to visit. To visit a Site that is occupied by another Hiker(s)-including your own-you must use your Campfire by flipping it over to the extinguished side.</p>\n\n<p>If your Campfire is extinguished, you cannot visit a Site occupied by another Hiker-including your own. A player's Campfire will relight when one of their Hikers reaches Trail End.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>At the Trail End</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game15.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Trail End gives Hikers a moment to reflect on the journey.</p>\n\n<p>When a Hiker arrives here, the player immediately relights their Campfire if it is extinguished, and then chooses one of the available areas for their Hiker- placing it vertically in the farthest right available slot of that area:</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Reserve a Park</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game16.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>To Reserve a Park, choose one of the three available Parks on the board or draw the card on the top of the Parks deck. Place the Park card face up horizontally in front of you-keeping it separate from your vertically-stacked visited Parks.</p>\n\n<p>If a Park was reserved from a board slot, re- veal a new Park from the Parks deck into the empty slot. When taking the Visit a Park action on a future turn, you may visit one of your reserved Parks or one of the three available on the board.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game17.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The first player to place their Hiker here also gains the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/t.jpg\"> First Hiker Marker as a benefit by placing their Hiker in the far right slot.</p>\n\n<p>After this, any number of other players may still Reserve Parks here, but they do not gain the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/t.jpg\">. The First Hiker Marker is worth 1 POINT at the end of the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Buy Gear</h3>\n\n<p>Gear supplements your journey-giving extra benefits at Trail Sites or making it easier to visit certain Parks. To buy Gear cards, place your Hiker on the BUY GEAR area.</p>\n\n<p>Select one of the three available Gear cards on the board and turn in <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/s.jpg\"> Sunshine equal to its cost. All Gear cards have ongoing abilities, and some have an additional <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/l.jpg\"> <b>INSTANT</b> action, activated one time immediately upon purchase. Place the Gear you acquire face up in front of you and utilize their ongoing abilities to their full potential.</p>\n\n<p>In a game of 3 or fewer players, the first Hiker to BUY GEAR, places their Hiker on the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/s.jpg\"> slot without 4+ on it-this gives them a 1 Sunshine discount on their Gear purchase.</p>\n\n<p>After this, any number of other players may buy Gear, but do not receive the discount. In games with 4+ players, the slot farthest right is also available, so the first two Hikers to choose this option each receive a 1 <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/s.jpg\"> discount on their Gear card.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game18.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>All Gear cards have ongoing abilities, but this one also has an <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/l.jpg\"> action that rewards the player with a Canteen card when purchased.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Visit a Park</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game19.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Any number of Hikers can occupy the Visit a Park area. To Visit a Park, choose one of the three available Parks on the board or one of your Reserved Parks and turn in its corresponding tokens from your area back to the supply.</p>\n\n<p>Take the Park card and place it vertically in your score area. The points denoted on the Park card will be scored at the end of the game. Parks can be stacked showing their resources and points. Whenever a Park is visited on the board, reveal a new Park from the Parks deck into the empty slot.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of a Season</h2>\n\n<p>Once a player's two Hikers reach Trail End they will no longer take turns for the Season. When only one Hiker is left on the Trail, the player must move the Hiker to Trail End and choose an action there. This marks the end of the Season, so the player with the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ca.jpg\"> may take a <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/ph.jpg\">. Start a new Season through these steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Empty all <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/gray.jpg\"> by returning their <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/o.jpg\"> to the supply.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Return all Hikers to the Trailhead.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Pick up all the Trail Sites (except for Trailhead and Trail End), and add an additional Advanced Site. Shuffle them and create the new Trail for the next Season. The Trail should now be one Site longer than the previous Season's Trail.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Put the previous Season card on the bottom of the Season deck and reveal the new Season from the top of the Season deck. Apply the Weather Pattern to the Trail as before.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The player with the <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/t.jpg\"> takes the first turn of the new Season.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Last Hiker On The Trail</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/game20.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>When only one Hiker remains on the Trail, the player must move that Hiker directly to the Trail End and choose an action there. Use this strategically to limit an- other player's time on the Trail.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Hiking tip:</b> Using your Campfire wisely can be the difference between spending more time on the Trail and missing out on certain Sites.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>When the fourth Season ends with its Photo opportunity, the game is over. All players reveal their Year cards, and then score points from their Parks, Photos, and Personal Bonus for their Year. The <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/parks/t.jpg\"> also gives 1 Point to the player who has it.</p>\n\n<p>The <b>player with the most points at the end is the winner</b> of Parks!</p>\n\n<p>If tied, the win goes to the player who visited the most Parks. If still tied, the win is shared.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"solo.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Buy long ribbons of land, rich and poor, laying rails to riches. Challenge your rivals as you civilize the wilds in a quest to connect people and spur the growth of cities.</p>\n\n<p>By carving new trade routes and unleashing increasingly powerful locomotives, you can bring humanity to the heavens. Using clever investment-and plenty of steel and steam- you can bring goods to far away markets... and track the winning way to wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Steam includes both a refined \"Base Game\" and a more detailed \"Standard Game\". If you're a new player or want a shorter game, start with the former. Read on. Soon you'll be ready to start laying track!</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Two-sided Game Board</li>\n<li>96 Goods Cubes (20 each of red, blue, yellow &amp; purple; 16 gray)</li>\n<li>144 Player Tokens (24 each of orange, green, natural, white, brown, black)</li>\n<li>136 Railway Track Tiles</li>\n<li>8 New City Tiles (1 red, 1 yellow, 1 purple, 1 blue, 4 gray)</li>\n<li>68 Money Tokens (1s in copper, 5s in silver, 10s in gold)</li>\n<li>7 Action Tiles (standard game side shown)</li>\n<li>10 City Growth Markers</li>\n<li>Goods Bag</li>\n<li>Turn Marker</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Steam is a game about building railroads and delivering goods along the network of tracks. You build the tracks and improve your locomotive to make the longest, most profitable deliveries possible. Moving goods around the map scores points that add to your income or victory points.</p>\n\n<p>Central to the game is a map, depicting the terrain, towns and cities in a region at the start of the railway age. The map of southeastern Canada and the north- eastern USA is ideal for 3 or 4 players. The map of Europe's lower Rhine and Ruhr region is more suitable for 4 or 5 players. We include pieces for 6 players, so you can play on larger expansion maps.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The maps are divided into hexagonal spaces (called \"hexes\"). Each hex shows either plains terrain (print- ed green), hills or mountains (printed brown), coast (green &amp; blue), or a city (a named and colored hex). Occasionally the hex contains a river (a blue line) or a town (town symbol).</p>\n\n<p>During the game, players build railroads by placing hexagonal track tiles (track) onto the map, connecting towns and cities in the process. Each section of track that connects a city to a city (see A in the diagram to the right), town to a city (see B's), or town to a town (see C) is called a \"link\".</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game1.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> Mountains and hills, though very different in real life, are the same (and called \"hills\") in Steam. The art and the game rules are identical for both!</p>\n\n<p>Each city starts with a supply of Goods cubes. They represent the establishment of long-term delivery contracts. Goods cubes are delivered along the \"links\" of a railway, either to increase income or score victory points.</p>\n\n<p>Each Goods cube can only be delivered to a city of the same color. As a result of player actions, each city printed on the map may receive extra Goods cubes once during the game.</p>\n\n<p>Gray cities do not appear on the printed maps; these only come into play via New City tiles.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to cities, each town on the map repre- sents an area that you can link to other towns and cities. A town does not supply or receive cubes. A town can expand (urbanize) to become a \"new city\", providing its own goods and delivery opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>A New City tile can replace a town tile already on the board, or it can be placed directly on a hex containing a town. Each new city opens up new opportunities for the railways and supplies extra Goods cubes.</p>\n\n<p>Although you may earn money at the end of each turn, it is often necessary to raise additional capital to pay for track and locomotive upgrades. You can raise additional short-term money by reducing your income level.</p>\n\n<p>There is a score track around the edge of the game board. Use it to record your current Victory Point (VP) score. You win by having the most Victory Points at the end of the game.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Base Game</h2>\n\n<p>The rules in this section) describe the Base Game, which we recommend for newer players or for shorter games.</p>\n\n<h3>Initial Set Up</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game4.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Place all the Goods cubes in the bag. Randomly draw cubes from the bag, placing as many on each city as the number printed on the city hex. If you are using the Europe (Ruhr) map and there are only three players, place one cube fewer on each city.</p>\n\n<p>Place three randomly drawn cubes on each Goods Supply space. If there are only three players in the game, place one cube fewer on each Goods Supply space (applies to both maps).</p>\n\n<p>Place the City Growth markers next to the map. Place the New City tiles next to the map. Each player chooses a set of tokens of one color.</p>\n\n<p>Place one of your tokens on the \"0\" space of the Income track, and another of your tokens on the \"0\" space of the Victory Point Track. You start with no income. In the Base Game, you may start with cash based on the initial turn order.</p>\n\n<p>Place one of your tokens on the \"1\" Locomotive box, marking your starting Locomotive Level. The Locomotive Level represents each railway's investment in rolling stock and engines. When you increase your Locomotive Level, it increases the number of links that a Goods cube can be moved along when you make a delivery.</p>\n\n<p>Appoint one player to be the banker and place the Money token supply near him. Place the turn marker on the \"1\" space of the Game Turn Track.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> If you want to use a scenario map, just place it on top of the map on the board. Then you can still use the other sections of the board.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game5.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Money</h2>\n\n<p>In Steam, players must raise money from the bank to spend on building track, upgrading their locomotives and meeting other costs. You give up income as you receive money from the bank. This represents the shares of company stock, payments, and favors that you have to grant in order to attract such investment.</p>\n\n<p>You receive money from the bank each time that you need to raise money. For every $5 that you receive, your token is moved one space down the Income Track.</p>\n\n<p>If you are already at -$ 10 income and you still need to raise money, you must then reduce your Victory Point (VP) total by 2 for every $5 that you raise. If you are at -$10 and zero VPs, you cannot raise any more money from the bank.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game6.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>You can raise money from the bank any time you have insufficient cash to pay for an item or action. You must spend any cash on hand first, before raising money in this way. You may not take more than the minimum that you need in order to cover any costs.</p>\n\n<p>If the amount you raise is more than you need, you receive cash from the bank for the difference (up to a maximum of $4). You are not allowed to raise extra money-only the money that you need to cover immediate payments.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Turn Order</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h3>Turn Order for Your First Game</h3>\n\n<p>Your position in the turn order is very important in Steam, but during your first game it is hard to know how much turn order position is worth. Accordingly, for your first game, we suggest that you determine the order of play randomly. Put the Action tiles in the bag and draw one for each player. The player who receives the lowest numbered tile goes first.</p>\n\n<p>The order of play will then go clockwise around the table. Mark the order of play using player tokens on the \"Turn Order Display;\" then return the Action tiles to the table. Before the first turn of the game, give $1 to the player going second, $2 to the player going third, and so on (only if using this system).</p>\n\n<p>The turn order in later turns will be determined by the Action tiles that you choose.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the start of the game, you determine the initial turn order by auction. If you win an auction, you must raise money to pay for your bid (see below).</p>\n\n<p>Auction the first player position first. Randomly determine a player to start bidding for turn order position (e.g., by using the Action tiles). Then proceed clockwise around the table.</p>\n\n<p>On your turn to bid, you may either increase the amount bid by the preceding player or pass. Once you have passed, you are out of the bidding for that player position. You cannot re-enter the auction until the next player position is put up for auction.</p>\n\n<p>When all other players have passed, you pay for your winning bid by moving your token down one space on the Income Track for every $5 that you need (receiving any change from the bank). Then place your token on the \"1\" space on the Turn Order Dis- play. Once you have won an auction, you may not bid in any of the remaining auctions.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game65.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The second player position is then auctioned, with bidding, starting with the player to the left of (clockwise from) the player who won the preceding auction.</p>\n\n<p>Continue conducting auctions for turn order until each player has placed a token on the Turn Order Display. There is no auction for last place; the remaining player takes the last spot for free. No starting money is distributed to the players when using auctions to determine turn order.</p>\n\n<p>You determine turn order for all subsequent turns based on the Action tiles you choose. You have to decide how important each action is to your plans, and how that will affect you in the turn order for the following turn.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Supply &amp; Demand</h3>\n\n<p>Goods cubes and the cities on the map share the same colors. Gray cities come onto the map later using the Urbanization action.</p>\n\n<p>Each city starts the game with a supply of goods (which are placed during setup) that represent commodities available for shipment to other cities. Extra cubes can be added to the map by using the City Growth action.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Each city demands only goods that match the color of the city. When you deliver a Goods cube along your railway links to a city that accepts that color of cube, you score track points. You must decide whether you wish to add those points to your income level or to your victory point score.</p>\n\n<p><b>Important:</b> If you receive track points from a delivery, you must take either all of the points from the delivery as income, or all of the track points as VPs. You cannot split track points from one delivery between your income and VP tracks!</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>You play Steam in a series of turns. Each turn encompasses 6 distinct phases. Complete each phase before moving on to the next phase. The game ends after phase 4 of the final turn. There are 7 turns in a five- or six-player game, 8 turns in a four-player game, and 10 turns in a three-player game.</p>\n\n<h3>The Six Phases</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Select Action Tiles</li>\n<li>Build Track</li>\n<li>Move Goods (or Improve Locomotive) (2 rounds)</li>\n<li>Collect Income &amp; Pay Expenses</li>\n<li>Determine Turn Order</li>\n<li>Set Up New Turn</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 1 - Select Action Tiles</h2>\n\n<p>Each turn, in your turn order, you select one Action tile. The Action tiles provide a special action or advantage that is unique in that turn, and have a value that will determine turn order for the next turn. The possible actions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Turn Order</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game8_.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>You will be in first place in the turn order for the next turn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>First Move</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game8.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>You will be the first player to move a Goods cube in each round of the Move Goods phase this turn, irrespective of your turn order position.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Engineer</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game9.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>You may build up to four track tiles during the Build Track phase instead of the usual three track tiles. You must pay the usual costs for all track built in this turn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>First Build</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game10.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>You will be the first player to build track during the Build Track phase, irrespective of your position in the turn order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>City Growth</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game11.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>During the Build Track phase, you select one set of Goods cubes from one Goods Supply space and add them to any city on the map. You must also place a City Growth marker onto the same city along with the Goods cubes.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot add cubes to a city if there is already a City Growth marker on the city (for example, any city created through Urbanization cannot have a City Growth action applied to it as it will already have a City Growth marker). Add goods to the map during your Build Track phase.</p>\n\n<p><i>You pay $2 when you select this action-this com- mits you to performing the action during your Build Track phase. You may instead pass.</i></p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game12.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>City Growth has a \"Pass Option\". This means that you may select it and then decide not to carry out the action (i.e., you \"pass\"). You must decide whether to perform City Growth or to exercise your Pass Option immediately upon taking the tile.</p>\n\n<p>If you take the Pass Option, flip your Action tile over (to its plain side) and do not pay the $2 cost. You do not carry out the action on the tile if you have chosen to pass.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Locomotive</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game13.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Immediately increase your Locomotive Level by one, moving your token to the next Locomotive box.</p>\n\n<p><i>You must pay the bank the $4 as shown on this tile, plus an amount equal to the Locomotive Level to which you are moving.</i></p>\n\n<p>The maximum Locomotive Level is 6. If you already have a level 6 locomotive, you cannot select this Action tile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h4>Urbanization</h4>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game15.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>During the Build Track phase, you convert a town into a city by placing a New City tile onto any hex containing a town. If the hex containing a town already has track built on it, first remove the track tile from the map and add it back to the track supply.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot select this Action tile if all of the towns have already been converted into cities, or if there are no New City tiles available.</p>\n\n<p><i>You pay $6 when you select this action-this commits you to performing the action during your Build Track phase. Since Urbanization has a Pass Option, you may instead pass.</i></p>\n\n<p>Add the New City tile to the board when you build track. You can place the tile any time during your part of the Building Track phase. The New City tile does not count as one of your 3 track tiles that you may build each turn (see example below).</p>\n\n<p>Once the New City tile is on the board, select a set of cubes from any one of the Goods Supply places. Place these cubes onto the just-built New City tile. Note that each New City tile has a City Growth marker printed on it; hence a New City tile cannot have more cubes added to it later in the game.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 2 - Build Track</h2>\n\n<p>You build track to connect cities and towns in order to deliver Goods cubes during the game. Track that starts at one city or town and finishes at a different city or town is called a \"link\". Your railway network need not be built entirely of contiguous connecting links (but this is often a successful strategy).</p>\n\n<p>You mark your ownership of a link with one of your tokens anywhere along the link. When you start building a link, it is easiest to put the token at the far (unconnected) end of the incomplete link. When your track reaches a city or town, that link is complete. Track used to make a link can be built over several turns.</p>\n\n<p>In turn order, you build track using the tiles that are available. If you chose the First Build Action tile, you carry out your track building before the player in the first position on the Turn Order Display.</p>\n\n<p>The first tile of track that you build in the game must touch a city hex, so that the track emerges from the city. Mark any track starting a new link with a player token <s class=\"tokenlabel\">B</s>. As you build more track, you must either extend the track that you have already built <s class=\"tokenlabel\">A</s> (placing the next piece of track connected to the previous one) or start a new link from any city on the board (but not a town) <s class=\"tokenlabel\">B</s>.</p>\n\n<p>When you build track, the tiles must line up so that the ends match and the track forms a continuous line (until it reaches another town or a city). All of the track that you build during the game must connect back to a city along track that you own. You are not allowed to build track that extends another player's track.</p>\n\n<p>You may build up to 3 track tiles in a single turn unless you took the Engineer Action tile (which allows you to build up to 4 pieces of track in the turn).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game17.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Other Track Building Limitations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You build track by placing track tiles onto the non- city hexes on the map. You cannot place track on non-hex spaces <s class=\"tokenlabel\">G</s>, nor on top of cities <s class=\"tokenlabel\">H</s>.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game18.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The map has hexes bordered or partially bordered by thick black lines. You cannot place track that crosses or runs into a hex side with a thick black line (D, F), or that runs into the edge of the board.</p>\n\n<p>Track never branches or forms any sort of junction except at a town or city (there are no \"Y\" track pieces). Track may not be placed that both starts and finishes in the same town or city <s class=\"tokenlabel\">C</s>. Players may build a series of links that together form a loop (and you may find it profitable to do so)!</p>\n\n<p>You are never required to build track. However, if you took the Urbanization or City Growth Action tiles and did not \"pass\", you must carry out those actions during your Build Track phase, whether or not you build any track. You can only build track using the track tiles that are available. You cannot play a particular track tile if there are none of that configuration left in the supply.</p>\n\n<h3>Paying For Initial Tracks</h3>\n\n<p>Each track tile built in an empty hex has a cost based on the terrain crossed and the complexity of the track. You pay for your track as you build it.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of placing a track tile on a hex is:</p>\n\n<p><b>Base cost:</b> It costs $1 for each edge of the tile where track exits the tile.</p>\n\n<p><b>Additional costs:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>+$1 if there is a town on the hex (see below)</li>\n<li>+$1 if there is a river on the hex (see below)</li>\n<li>+$2 if the tile is placed on a hills hex (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> The base cost for the most common track (straights and gentle curves) is $2, while the base cost increases to $3 or $4 for more complex tiles. See the Tile Manifest on page 16.</p>\n\n<p>You must pay the cost of the track you build during your building phase, even if you are improving an existing tile as part of your building. However, you do not have to pay terrain costs when you improve or redirect a piece of track.</p>\n\n<h3>Terrain</h3>\n\n<p>The following rules detail the effects of various features detailed on the map:</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game23.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Hills (&amp; Mountains) Hex</h4>\n\n<p>A hills hex is covered entirely with the brown hills &amp; mountains art. Each hills hex has a white border completely surrounding it.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game24.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>City Hex</h4>\n\n<p>A city hex is either a fully colored city printed on the board, or a hex containing a New City tile placed through Urbanization.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game26_.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Plains (&amp; Coast) Hex</h4>\n\n<p>Any hex that is not a hills hex or a city hex is considered to be a plains hex for building purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Note that coast hexes, despite some being primarily water, are treated the same as plains tiles (you are assumed to be building along the coast). Non-river, coastal water is outlined in white.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game26.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Coastal water is impassable-see Lake Ontario, the New England coast and the inlet southeast of Providence on the New York map.</p>\n\n<p>Impassable water has a heavy black line along certain hex sides. Track may not run into or cross a hex side marked by such a heavy black line.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game28.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h4>Rivers</h4>\n\n<p>A river is depicted on the map by blue with dark edges-this category also includes (purple-edged) canals and smaller lakes. A hex contains a river if it has part or parts of one or more rivers in them.</p>\n\n<h3>Towns</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game22.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>A hex contains a town if it has a glowing town symbol.</p>\n\n<p>Certain track tiles, town track tiles, bear a different, corresponding town track symbol. You can only place a town track tile on a hex that contains a town. You cannot place any other track tile (i.e., non town track tile) on a hex that contains a town.</p>\n\n<p>However, you can use Urbanization to place a New City tile on a hex that contains a town.</p>\n\n<h3>Town Track Tiles</h3>\n\n<p>Some town track tiles have only one piece of track leading to the town; other town track tiles may have several pieces. If you build track on a hex containing a town, you can choose which town track tile to use.</p>\n\n<p>You will own any pieces of track leading from the town unless they are already connected to another player's track (although some ownership might be temporary-see \"Incomplete Links\" below).</p>\n\n<p>You must pay for all track printed on a town track you place. You lose ownership of any incomplete links if they are not extended on your next turn.</p>\n\n<h3>Urbanization</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game25.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If you took the Urbanization Action tile (and did not use the Pass Option), you must place a New City tile with new Goods cubes on the map during your turn to build track. City hexes are considered to have track running to the edge of every side of the hex.</p>\n\n<p>So placing a New City tile may complete one or more links (even links belonging to other players). Placing a New City tile does not count as one of your three hexes of track building.</p>\n\n<h3>City Growth</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game27.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If you took the City Growth Action tile (and not the Pass Option), you must place new Goods cubes and a City Growth marker onto a city hex on the map during your</p>\n\n<p>turn to build track. You cannot place new cubes on a city already containing a City Growth marker (e.g., you can never place new cubes on a New City tile).</p>\n\n<p>If you run out of Goods cubes during the game, do not refill the display. You only place cubes on the board and the display at the start of the game. Never draw extra cubes from the bag during the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Incomplete Links</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game29.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If any track fails to reach either a town or city by the end of your turn, it is an \"incomplete link\". An incomplete link consists of one or more track tiles that do not connect to a town or city at each end.</p>\n\n<p>An incomplete link is still marked with your token, and other players may not extend it while you own it. However, you lose ownership of the incomplete link if you do not extend it on your very next turn.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not extend the track in the next turn, you must remove your token from the track. It then becomes an unowned, incomplete link.</p>\n\n<h3>Unowned Track</h3>\n\n<p>When you place a track tile or a New City tile that extends or completes an unowned, incomplete link, you \"claim\" the link and mark your ownership with one of your tokens. You can only claim an unowned, incomplete link if it either starts at a city or it directly connects to one of your own links.</p>\n\n<p>If you claim an incomplete link and it remains incomplete, you must extend it or complete it on your next turn or you lose ownership of it.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> You cannot lose or relinquish control of your completed links (unless you are eliminated).</p>\n\n<h3>Redirecting Track</h3>\n\n<p>You may \"redirect\" (change) the last track tile placed in an incomplete link so that its track exits in a different direction. You can only redirect an unowned, incomplete link if it either starts at a city or it directly connects to one of your own links.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot redirect track on another player's link. Completed links cannot be altered or redirected. You may either rotate the last track tile of an incomplete link, or remove the tile and replace it with a different tile.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you rotate the track or replace it, you must pay the non-terrain tile costs again-the town and track costs, but not the hills and river costs. The new tile-and its track-must still comply with all of the usual track building rules (for example, you cannot redirect a tile so that it runs off the edge of the board).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game30.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Redirecting a track tile counts as one of your three pieces of track that can be built in a given turn. Redirecting track does not count as extending track for the purposes of maintaining or claiming ownership of incomplete links. However, you can claim such an unowned, incomplete link if redirecting it completes the link.</p>\n\n<p>Track on a hex containing a town cannot be redirected, but it is possible to improve the town track tile by changing it to one with more tracks leading from the town.</p>\n\n<h3>Improving Existing Track</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes you will want to build new track over or through either your own or another player's track. This is done by replacing the track that has already been built with one of the complex crossing or passing tiles or a town track tile with more tracks leading from the town.</p>\n\n<p>You must preserve the existing track in the hex-you can add new track to a hex but you are not allowed to change or take away existing track (unless redirecting track, as detailed in the rules above).</p>\n\n<p>There is a cost of \"improving\" track in this way. You must pay for all of the track shown on the new track tile that you place on the board, not just the new track added by the crossing, passing, or exits from the town. You must also pay the extra $1 if there is a town symbol on the tile. However, you do not pay any cost associated with the terrain printed on the board (i.e., hills and rivers).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game32.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>When building, you may only use the track tiles available. If you cannot find a tile with the track configuration that you need, you cannot build that track. Improved track counts as one of your three track builds for the turn.</p>\n\n<p>You may choose to build one of the complex crossing or passing tiles on an empty hex. If you do this, all the usual building rules and terrain costs apply.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 3 - Move Goods (or Improve Locomotive)</h2>\n\n<p>Each turn, in your turn order, you must choose and perform one of the following activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>improve your locomotive,</li>\n<li>move a Goods cube, or</li>\n<li>pass (and do nothing).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once each player has performed one of these activities, each player (in turn order) once again chooses and performs one of these activities. If you improved your locomotive with your first activity, you may not choose it as your second activity in the same turn.</p>\n\n<p>If you took the First Move Action tile, choose and perform your activity before anyone else in each cycle.</p>\n\n<h3>Improving Your Locomotive</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game34.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>You start the game with a level 1 locomotive. This allows you to deliver a Goods cube along a route with a maximum length of one link. During the game you may improve your locomotive, both by taking the Locomotive Action tile or by using one of your activities during the Move Goods phase.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a level 2 locomotive to deliver a Goods cube along a route of up to two links; a level 3 locomotive can travel up to three links, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>You may only choose to improve your locomotive level once per turn during the Move Goods phase. This improvement costs nothing and scores no victory points. With your other Move Goods activity, you must either move a Goods cube or pass. You get nothing for passing.</p>\n\n<h3>Moving a Goods Cube</h3>\n\n<p>As one of your activities during the Move Goods phase, you may move one Goods cube from one city to another city-you deliver it. You can only move a Goods cube along completed track links (yours and your opponents; see below). The maximum number of links moved along must be less than or equal to your locomotive's level.</p>\n\n<p>You can only move a Goods cube if its final destination is a city of the same color as the cube. You cannot move a Goods cube so that it finishes its journey in a town or a city of a color different from the Goods cube.</p>\n\n<p>The cube is delivered as soon as it reaches the first city on its journey that is the same color as the cube. You are not allowed to move such a cube any further. You cannot return the cube to the city where it started, and you cannot move it into or through the same city more than once on its journey.</p>\n\n<p>When you deliver a Goods cube, you must move it along at least one of your links. You can use opponents' links to deliver cubes, but you must use your own links at least as much as you use any other player's links. You cannot deliver the cube if it only travels along links that belong to other players.</p>\n\n<p>Remove delivered Goods cubes from the game and place them back in the Goods Bag.</p>\n\n<h3>Track Points</h3>\n\n<p>When you deliver a Goods cube, you score 1 track point for each completed link of your track that the cube was moved along. Each opponent whose track you used also gets 1 track point per link of his that you used.</p>\n\n<p>Each scoring player must immediately decide whether to use his track points to increase his income or to increase his victory points. You cannot split your points gained from a single cube movement between income and victory points. (See example at right).</p>\n\n<p>If two or more players receive points from the same delivery, the player moving the Goods cube chooses whether to take his points as income or victory points first, and then the rest choose in turn order.</p>\n\n<p>If your victory point total exceeds 50, place one of your tokens in the +50 box. Use your other VP token to track your points over 50. Use the +100 box in the rare case you acquire more than 100 victory points.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game35.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 4 - Collect Income &amp; Pay Expenses</h2>\n\n<p>In player order, each player collects income or pays all expenses.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/steam/game37.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Check where your token is on the Income Track. If the figure is positive, you receive this amount from the bank. If the figure is negative, you must pay this money to the bank (a situation that is very likely to happen at the beginning of the game).</p>\n\n<p>If you do not have the cash necessary to pay your debt, you will have to raise more money from the bank and move further down the Income Track (or VP track if you are already at -$ 10). You pay according to where your token is at the start of the phase.</p>\n\n<p>In the unlikely event that your token is at -$10 on the Income Track, and you cannot afford to make a required payment, then you must raise the necessary money by reducing your VP total by 2 for each $5 required. If you do not have sufficient VPs to meet your costs, you are bankrupt!</p>\n\n<p>Your tokens are removed from the board and you are out of the game. Any completed links that you owned remain unowned for the duration of the game (no one may claim them).</p>\n\n<p>Remaining players may claim any incomplete links that you owned in the usual manner. If a Goods cube is moved along an unowned link, no victory points or income are scored for that link.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 5 - Determine Turn Order</h2>\n\n<p>Adjust the players' tokens on the Turn Order Display according to the actions selected at the start of the turn. The order of play goes from lowest value action to highest value action. Mark the new turn order on the Turn Order Display.</p>\n\n<p>If a player selected an action but then chose to pass, the value of the action still determines his position in the order of play.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Phase 6 - Set Up New Turn</h2>\n\n<p>The players return all of the Action tiles to beside the board. Move the turn marker forward one space on the Game Turn Track and a new turn is started (unless you have reached the end of the game).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>If you are playing with 3 players, the game finishes after 10 turns. A four-player game lasts 8 turns, and with five players the game lasts 7 turns. On the final turn, skip phases 5 and 6.</p>\n\n<h4>Calculating Victory Points</h4>\n\n<p>First, increase your VPs by one point for every two points of income that you have at the end of the game, rounding down if necessary (e.g., if you had an income of $5 then you would receive 2 VPs).</p>\n\n<p>If you have negative income, reduce your VPs by twice that amount (e.g., if you had an income of -$2 then you would lose 4 VPs). You receive no VPs (or penalty) for zero income.</p>\n\n<p>Next, remove all of the player tokens on incomplete link segments. Then you score 1 point for every com- pleted link that you own at the end of the game. Add these to your VP score on the VP Track. You do not score any points for incomplete links.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the <b>most Victory Points, you win</b>.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a tie, the tied player with the highest income level wins. If there is still a tie, then the player who took the lowest numbered Action tile in the final turn wins. Only one player can win.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Nick earned 37points during the game for deliveries. His Income Track token was on -1 at the end of the game, and he had 10 completed links on the board. His final score is: 37-2 + 10 = 45 Victory Points.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"standard-game.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Discard the bags. Carefully punch out the information cards. Then, set up the following each time you play:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>Put the gameboard on the playing surface and cluster the gray tiles facedown near it.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Choose a player to be the stock market banker. The banker sets up the stock market tray.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The banker gives each player an information card and $6,000 (four $1,000 bills, three $500 bills and five $100 bills). The rest of the money is separated by denomination and placed into four separate piles.</p></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h5>Determine who goes first</h5>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/acquire/board.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Each player draws a tile from the facedown cluster and puts it faceup on the matching letter/number space on the gameboard. The player who plays a tile closest to 1A goes first.</p>\n\n<p>(9A is closer than 1B). Leave the tiles on the gameboard.</p>\n\n<p>Note: If two or more of these tiles are adjacent, they are considered unincorporated tiles. If an additional tile is added later, then they become a corporation.</p>\n\n<p>All players draw six tiles and stand them up so that the other players can't see them.</p>\n\n<h5>Show or hide assets</h5>\n\n<p>Players must now decide as a group whether the money and stocks they acquire will be openly displayed. An open display is strongly recommended for new or inexperienced players.</p>\n\n<p>If money and stock are not displayed, the game is even more challenging because players must try to remember how much stock each player has purchased.</p>\n\n<p>Note: At any time during the game, a player may ask how many stocks of a company are still unpurchased.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>Each player does the following three things in order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Play a tile onto the gameboard by putting it on its matching space.</li>\n<li>Buy stocks of any active corporations. There is a limit of three total per turn.</li>\n<li>Draw a new tile from the facedown cluster.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2>1. Playing a Tile</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/acquire/tiles.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Depending upon where a tile is played, it may form a corporation or it may merge two or more corporations. (Of course, a tile may also be played which does nothing).</p>\n\n<h3>Founding a corporation</h3>\n\n<p>When a player places a tile next to an unincorporated tile already on the gameboard (vertically or horizontally - not diagonally), a corporation is founded. The corporation founder first selects an available corporation building marker from the stock market tray and places it on any one of the corporation's tiles. The player then receives a free founder's bonus stock (of that corporation) from the tray.</p>\n\n<p>Note: If players are already holding all the corporation's stock cards, then no founder's bonus stock is given out.</p>\n\n<p>Any tile that would form an eighth corporation cannot be played. (There are only seven corporations in the game). However, such a tile might be played later in the game if a merger makes a corporate building marker available again.</p>\n\n<h3>Merging corporations</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/acquire/acquire.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>When a player places a tile so that it connects two (or more) corporations, a merger takes place. The larger corporation (the one with more tiles) survives and the smaller corporation becomes defunct. During the merger, the merging tile does not add to the size of either corporation for any riurpose.</p> <p>If the corporations are the same size, then the mergemaker decides which corporation survives. The surviving corporation absorbs the defunct one. The corporation building marker of the defunct company is removed from the gameboard and returned to the tray.</p>\n\n<p>Note: If more than two corporations are merged by one tile, see Multiple Mergers section below for details.</p>\n\n<h4>Safe corporations</h4>\n\n<p>A corporation that contains 11 or more tiles is considered \"safe\" and cannot be absorbed by another corporation for the rest of the game. A safe corporation can absorb a smaller corporation, but two safe corporations cannot merge. Any tile that would merge two safe corporations is permanently unplayable and can be discarded and replaced later in the turn.</p>\n\n<h3>Majority and minority stockholders' bonuses</h3>\n\n<p>At the time of a merger, all players must reveal the exact number of stocks in the defunct company that they own. The players with the most and second-most stocks are declared majority and minority stockholders. The banker pays them the majority and minority stockholders' bonuses as described below.</p>\n\n<p>If only one player owns stock in the defunct corporation, that player gets both bonuses. If there is a tie for majority stockholder, add the majority and minority bonuses together, divide evenly and round up to the next payable dollar amount if necessary. (The minority shareholder gets no bonus). If there is a tie for minority stockholder, split the minority bonus among the tied players. Round resulting bonuses up to the nearest $100 if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>To determine the bonus amount, find the defunct corporation's name on any information card. Then look down the card to the number of tiles in the defunct corporation. Then look across the card to the majority and minority bonus amounts. This bonus money comes from the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Stockholders in the surviving corporation don't get any bonuses, but the value of their stock will probably go up because the corporation has grown larger.</p>\n\n<p>After bonuses have been paid out, each stockholder must decide what to do with the defunct stock. Each player, starting with the mergemaker and continuing clockwise, can hold, sell, and trade the defunct stock cards.</p>\n\n<h3>Hold</h3>\n\n<p>Stock may be held in expectation of starting another corporation with that name later.</p>\n\n<h3>Sell</h3>\n\n<p>Stock may be sold back to the stock market at a price determined by the number of tiles in the defunct corporation before the merger.</p>\n\n<h3>Trade</h3>\n\n<p>Stock may be traded. For every two defunct stock cards traded in, the player gets one stock in the surviving corporation. Of course, the supply of surviving stock cards is limited, so you can't acquire stock that is not available.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Players are allowed to choose more than one of the above options. For example, a player could hold onto a few of the defunct stocks, sell some and trade some.</p>\n\n<h3>Multiple mergers</h3>\n\n<p>It is possible that one tile could cause the merger of three or four corporations. The largest corporation survives and the smaller ones become defunct. The mergemaker breaks any ties.</p>\n\n<p>The smaller corporations are dealt with - one at a time - from largest to smallest. Majority and minority stockholder bonuses are paid out as described previously, and then the defunct stock is held, sold or traded. As usual, the mergemaker goes first.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/acquire/stocks.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<h2>2. Buying Stocks</h2>\n\n<p>After placing a tile, the player may buy stock in any active corporation. This is optional. A player may decide to buy none or up to three stock cards on a turn.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a player can buy one stock card in three different active corporations - or one in one corporation and two in another - or three stock cards in one corporation.</p>\n\n<h4>Price per share</h4>\n\n<p>This is determined by first finding the name of the corporation on any information card, looking down the card to the number of tiles in the corporation and then looking across the card to the stock price. Money is paid into the stock market tray. Remember, there are only 25 stocks for each corporation, so when all 25 are sold, no more can be purchased.</p>\n\n<h4>Running out of money</h4>\n\n<p>Aggressively competing to become the majority stockholder in a corporation can be risky. Invest wisely in corporations that are small and close to bigger ones.</p>\n\n<p>A player who runs out of money cannot buy stock. A player with no money still places a tile on each of his/her turns, if possible, but must wait for a corporation in which he/she owns stock to go defunct in order to get money. Remember, a player can sell a corporation's stock only after the corporation has gone defunct, and at the end of the game. No loans are allowed from other players or the stock market bank.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>3. Drawing a Tile</h2>\n\n<p>A player takes a tile from the facedown cluster to replace the one he/she played. This is not done until the end of the turn. At this time, if a player has any permanently unplayable tiles (ones that merge two safe corporations), that player puts the unplayable tiles to the side (faceup) and draws an equal number of replacement tiles.</p> <p>This can only be done once per turn. If more unplayable tiles are drawn, the player must wait until his/her next turn to discard them. Tiles that would form an eighth corporation cannot be traded in.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends when one player, during his/her turn, announces that either all active corporations are safe or that one corporation has 41 or more tiles on the gameboard.</p>\n\n<p>A player does not have to announce that the game is over if it is to his/her advantage to continue playing. After announcing that the game is over, the player may finish the turn.</p>\n\n<p>Majority and minority shareholders' bonuses are paid out for all active corporations, and all stocks are sold back to the stock market bank at current prices (as shown on the information cards).</p>\n\n<p>Stock in a corporation that is not on the board is worthless. The player with the most money wins the game.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"tips.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

Therefore, the red 2, 3, 4 and 6 may not be crossed out later in the game. In the yellow row only the 11 and the 12 may still be crossed out. In the green row you can only cross out numbers to the right of the 6. In the blue row you can only cross out right of the 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tip:</b> Put a small horizontal line through the numbers that you skipped, so that you don't cross them out later by accident.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/qwixx/game.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<p>The first player to roll a 6 takes on the role of \"active player\". The active player rolls all six dice. The following two actions are now carried out in order, always one after the other:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/qwixx/game1.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The active player adds up the two white dice and announces out loud, the resulting sum.</p>\n\n<p>All players may then (but are not required to) cross out the number that the active player announced in any (but only one) of the color-rows.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Chris is the active player. The two white dice show a 4 and a 1. Chris announces, \"five\". Tony crosses out the yellow 5 on his score sheet. Caroline crosses out the red 5. Annie and Nora choose not to cross out a number.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/qwixx/game2.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The active player (but not the others) may then (but is not required to) add one of the white dice together with any one of the colored dice and cross out the number corresponding to this sum in the color-row corresponding to the color of the chosen die.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Chris adds together the white 4 with the blue 6 and crosses out the 10 in the blue color-row.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Penalties</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/qwixx/game9.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If, after the two actions, the active player doesn't cross out at least one number, he must cross out one of the penalty boxes. Each penalty box is worth -5 points at the end of the game. (The non-active players do not take a penalty if they choose not to cross out a number).</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of a Round</h2>\n\n<p>Once all players are ready, the player to the left becomes the new active player and re-rolls all six dice. Then the two actions described on the left are carried out again, one after the other.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Locking a Row</h2>\n\n<p>If you wish to cross out the number at the extreme right end of a color-row (red 12, yellow 12, green 2, blue 2) you must have first crossed out at least five numbers in that row.</p>\n\n<p>If you cross out the number on the extreme right, then also cross off the lock symbol directly next to it. This indicates that the color-row is now locked for all players and numbers of this color cannot be crossed out in future rounds.</p>\n\n<p>The die of the corresponding color is immediately removed from the game.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/qwixx/game3.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Alison crosses out the green 2 and after it, the lock symbol. The green die is removed from the game.</p>\n\n<h5>Notes:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If a row is locked during the first action, it is possible that other players may, at the same time, also cross out the number on the extreme right and lock the same color-row. These players must also have previously crossed out at least five numbers in that row.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The cross on the lock counts toward the total number of crosses marked in that color-row.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>The game ends immediately as soon as either someone has marked a cross in his fourth penalty box or as soon as two dice have been removed from the game (two color-rows have been locked).</p>\n\n<p>It may occur (during the first action) that a third row is locked simultaneously with the second row.</p>\n\n<h4>Scoring</h4>\n\n<p>Beneath the four color-rows is a table indicating how many points are awarded for how many crosses within each row (including any locks marked with a cross).</p>\n\n<p>Each crossed out penalty box scores five minus-points. Enter your points for the four color-rows and the minus-points for any penalties in the appropriate fields at the bottom of the scoresheet</p>\n\n<p>The player with the highest total score is the winner.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/qwixx/game4.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Alison has 4 crosses in red, which gives her 10 points; in yellow, she has 3 (=6 points); in green 8 (=36 points); and in blue 7 (= 28 points). For her two penalties she must subtract 10 points. This means that Alison's total score is 70 points.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"deluxe.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

The more Exits <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/u.jpg\"> you connect to the same Network, the more points it will be worth.

These Routes2 may allow you to connect different Network4 together and/or make bigger Networks.</p>\n\n<p>You may draw a Special Route once per round, in addition to the Routes shown on the Route dice, but you may use each Special Route only once per game.</p>\n\n<p>After you use a Special Route, you must mark it off on your board as a reminder that you can't use it again. Also, you can only use up to 3 Special Routes during the entire game (and remember, only 1 per round).</p>\n\n<table class=\"image-description\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game10.jpg\"><br><b>Remember</b>: Only 1 Special Route per round, and only up to 3 per game!</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Round</h2>\n\n<table class=\"image-description floatr\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game13.jpg\"><br>Example: The end of the 5th round.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\n<p>Once all the players have drawn all of the available Routes, the round ends.</p>\n\n<p>Each player must mark the spaces where they drew Routes this round by writing the number of the current round in the white boxes of each space they drew on. You can never erase the Routes you drew in a previous round.</p>\n\n<p>After that, roll the Route Dice to start the next round.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game12.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game14.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>The game ends after the 7th round. Now it's time to count your score!</p>\n\n<p>Each player counts the points they earned for their connected Exits <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/u.jpg\">, their Longest Railway and Longest Highway, and the Central Spaces they drew on, marking their points on the designated spaces of the Scoring Table on their boards.</p>\n\n<p>Then, each player must check for incomplete Routes. Each end of a Route that does not connect with any other Route or the outer edge of the board counts as an Error. Mark each one of these Errors with this symbol: <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/x.jpg\">.</p>\n\n<p>You lose 1 point for each Error on your board. Mark these penalty points on the matching space of your Scoring Table.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> If you are playing with an Expansion <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/s.jpg\">, mark any additional points on the expansion space of your scoring board.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, add up all the points you earned (subtracting any points from Errors) and write your total score on your Scoring Table. The player with the most points wins! In case of a tie, the winner is the player with the fewest Error marks on their board. If they're still tied, the victory is shared.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<h4>Connecting Exits</h4>\n\n<p>Connecting Exits <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/u.jpg\"> is the main way to score points in Railroad Ink. At the end of the game, each set of Exits that are connected to each other via the same Network of Routes is worth a number of points determined by the number of Exits connected together, as shown on the Network Values on your Board.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game16.jpg\"><br>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note 1:</b> Overpasses only allow you to make two of your Networks cross each other, but they don't create a connection between the two.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note 2:</b> You can use Stations to connect Railway Routes and Highway Routes to each other.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n\n<h4>Bonus Points</h4>\n\n<p>While the points you get for connecting Exits <img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/u.jpg\"> may end up being the bulk of your score when you add up points at the end of the game, do not underestimate the importance of the bonus points you can earn from your Longest Highway, Longest Railway, and Central Spaces.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game31.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Your <b>Longest Highway</b> is ; the longest unbroken streak of adjacent spaces where you drew Highway Routes that are connected to each other (not counting any loops or branches), such as the route marked in blue to the right. You score 1 point for each space that makes up your single longest Highway branch. Stations do not interrupt your Highway. This example show a Longest Highway of 8 spaces.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game32.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Your Longest Railway is determined the same way as the Longest Highway,, only counting Railway Routes instead of Highway Routes, like the one marked in red to the right (worth 5 points).</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game21.jpg\" class=\"floatl\">\n\n<p>Your <b>Central Spaces</b> are the 9 spaces in the middle of your board. You score 1 point for each Central Space you drew anything on.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game22.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/railroad-ink/game20.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>If you have two Longest Routes (with the same number of spaces), only 1 counts towards your final score.</p>\n\n<br class=\"break\">\n<a href=\"expansions.php\" class=\"nextpage\">Continue Reading</a>\n\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n",

But beware of the competition! Who will best accomplish the city's plans by creating the nicest housing estates in the three streets they've been assigned? Will your luxurious parks and fancy pools be enough to earn you title of Best Architect?</p>\n\n<p>Welcome To is a game where everyone plays at the same time with the same cards. It's all about cleverly combining the house numbers with their associated effects in order to become the greatest architect of tomorrow !</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n<h5>29 City Plan Cards</h5>\n\n<p>18 City Plans for the basic game &amp; 10 City Plans for the advanced variant (marked by a ). One Solo card included for the solo variant. Cards numbered 1, 2, or 3 with a Project side &amp; an Approved side.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game2.jpg\"><br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>81 Construction Cards</h5>\n\n<p>(House number on one side &amp; effect on back)</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game6.jpg\"><br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>4 Player Aids</h5>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game8.jpg\"><br><br>\n</li>\n<li>\n\n<h5>100 Player Sheets</h5>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game9.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Object of the Game</h2>\n\n<p>Architects gradually develop their three streets by building houses, identified by their numbers. Houses will be grouped into housing estates, but only fully-completed ones count at the end of the game.</p>\n\n<p>Parks and pools help to improve the neighborhood. Architects can raise the quality of their constructions in order to promote their estates' value. All of this while trying to be the first to complete the City Plans!</p>\n\n<p>Finally, by increasing recruitment through temp agencies, architects can hasten the construction and get in the mayor's good graces.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each player takes a pen or pencil (not provided) and a sheet from the player sheet. y Distribute the Player Aids to the players.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Shuffle and randomly choose 3 City Plan cards from the basic set: one n°1, one n°2, and one n°3. Place them \" Project \" side face up so all players may see. Return all remaining City Plans to the box.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Shuffle the Construction cards. Deal 3 equal stacks of 27 each, house number face up. Place these in a column with room for discards to their right.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game13.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Game Play</h2>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game15.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>At the beginning of each turn, flip over the top card of each construction stack and place it to the right with its effect displayed. These stacks create three combinations, comprised of a House Number and an Effect. These combinations are used to perform actions.</p>\n\n<p>Players take turns simultaneously. Each player individually chooses one of the three combinations available to perform an action on their sheet. Multiple players can pick the same combination.</p>\n\n<p>Each player must write the number from the chosen combination in a house on one of the three streets on their sheet. Numbers must always be written in an empty house and must be written in ascending order from left to right.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game19.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>The same number can never appear twice in the same street.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<h4>Note</h4>\n\n<p>When filling in houses, players may leave as many empty houses between two built houses, and then fill them in later. Numbers must still be in ascending order.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game16.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Also, players may skip numbers when filling in houses, like placing a 10 directly after a 7.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game17.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game18.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>If a player cannot follow the placement rules, they do not fill in a house number and receive a building permit refusal. Cross off the top-most, lowest-numbered space.</p>\n\n<p>The player's chosen combination also allows them to perform an effect. Players may perform the effect only if they did not receive a building permit refusal. Note: performing an effect is optional.</p>\n\n<p>Once all players have built their houses and carried out effects, a new turn begins. If the construction stacks are ever empty, reshuffle them and deal out as before.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Effects</h2>\n\n<h3>Surveyor</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game22.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Allows the player to build a fence between two houses on the same street. To build a fence, choose any available, white-dotted space and draw a line on it. Permanent fences are present on both sides of each street.</p>\n\n<p>Fences determine the boundaries of housing estates. A completed housing estate is a row of 1 to 6 neighboring houses, all numbered (no blank spaces between them) and built between two fences.</p>\n\n<p>Completed housing estates are necessary to fulfill City Plans and may be split further, as long as they have not previously fulfilled a City Plan).</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> The architect has written a 5 on the third house of the second street in order to start a 3-house estate. Then they built a fence between the first and the second house of the first street, therefore splitting a 3-House estate into 1-house and 2-house estates.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game23.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Real Estate Agent</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game24.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Promotes and increases the value of completed housing estates. To use the Real Estate Agent, choose a Real Estate column and cross off the top-most, lowest- numbered space.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the game, each completed estate (size 2, 3, 4, etc..). scores as many points as the smallest, unchecked number from its corresponding column.</p>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> After crossing off the top-most space in the 2-House estate column, each 2-house estate now scores 3 points at game end. The 3- and 4-house estates score points equal to their initial amount.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game26.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Landscaper</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game27.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Allows the player to build a park. The player crosses off one of the trees at the end of the street. Parks must be crossed off on the same street that the house number is written. Parks are crossed off, left- to-right in ascending order.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game28.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<h3>Pool Manufacturer</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game29.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Allows a player to score points when building houses that have a planned pool. If a player writes the house number associated with the Pool Manufacturer effect in a house with a planned pool, then the pool is built. Cross off the top-most, lowest-numbered space in their pools column.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> A player can use a house number/effect combination without a Pool Manufacturer effect to write a number in a house.</p>\n\n<p>Oppositely, a player can write a number associated with the Pool Manufacturer effect in a house without a pool. However, in both cases, the pool is not built; therefore the player does not cross off a new pool in their pools column.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game26_.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Temp Agency</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game30.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Allows the player to add or subtract 1 or 2 to the house number they are building. The Temp Agency allows the player to write numbers from 0 to 17. For each use of the Temp Agency, cross off one box from the Temp Agency column. At the end of the game, the player who crossed off the most Temp</p>\n\n<p>Agency boxes scores 7 points. The next highest scores 4 points, and the third highest scores 1 point. In case of a tie, players score the same amount of points.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game34.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p><i>Example:</i> Using a number 8 card, build a house with the number 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Then, cross off one box.</p>\n\n<h3>«bis»</h3>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game31.jpg\" class=\"floatr\">\n\n<p>Allows the player to duplicate a house number on any street. The new house must be directly adjacent, to the left or right of the house with the same number. Duplicate houses can never be separated by fences.</p>\n\n<p>When duplicating a number, write \"bis\" next to the number in the new house. A house can be duplicated multiple times, and the duplicated number does not have to be associated with the number/effect combination.</p>\n\n<p>Cross off the top-most, lowest-numbered space in the \"bis\" column. At the end of the game, subtract the smallest, unchecked number from the final score.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game35.jpg\"><br>\n\n<br>\n<h2>City Plans</h2>\n\n<p>A City Plan presents a goal set by the City to its architects, as in building a certain number of housing estates with mandated sizes.</p>\n\n<p>The first player(s) who meet the required conditions of a City Plan during the same turn immediately score the points indicated. Write the higher amount from the \"Project\" side of the City Plan card in the corresponding box (n°1, 2, or 3) in their Plans column.</p>\n\n<p>Turn over the City Plan to its \"Approved\" side. A player can only score each City Plan once.</p>\n\n<img src=\"scraped_rules/images/welcome-to/game37.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n<p>Other players who later achieve the same City Plan score the lower point amount.</p>\n\n<h3>Housing Estates Plans</h3>\n\n<p>To fulfill these City Plans, the player must complete all of the required housing estates.</p>\n\n<p>The estates do not have to be in the same street.
