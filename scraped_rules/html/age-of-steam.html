<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/components.jpg" class="floatr">
<ul>
<li>1 Game Board</li>
<li>1 Goods/ Actions display</li>
<li>1 Income Track display</li>
<li>8 Town disks (white)</li>
<li>136 hexagonal Track tiles</li>
<li>8 hexagonal New City tiles (1 red, 1 blue, 1 purple, 1 yellow, 4 black)</li>
<li>96 Goods cubes (20 red, 20 blue, 20 purple, 20 yellow, 16 black)</li>
<li>6 sets of Track Ownership Locomotives, (red, green, yellow, purple, blue, black, 20 of each)</li>
<li>6 sets of Player disks, (red, green, yellow, purple, blue, black, 5 of each)</li>
<li>40 $1 bills</li>
<li>40 $5 bills</li>
<li>10 $10 bills</li>
<li>1 Turn Track marker</li>
<li>6 dice</li>
<li>1 Black Cloth Bag</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Lay out the game board. Place the following items next to the game board: Goods/Actions display, Income Track display, Money, New City tiles, Dedicated Town Track tiles, and 8 Town disks.</p>

<p>Place the Turn Track marker in the "start" circle on the Turn Track. Put all the Goods cubes in the bag and randomly draw one cube at a time, placing it in the Goods display. Begin by placing the first cube in the upper left hand square, the second in the square to the right, filling out the entire first row with one randomly drawn cube in each square. When the uppermost row is filled, fill the remaining rows until each square contains one cube, for a total of 52 cubes.</p>

<p>Randomly draw three Goods cubes and place them in Pittsburgh. Randomly draw three Goods cubes and place them in Wheeling. For the remaining cities on the game board, randomly draw and place two Goods cubes in each city.</p>

<p>Players choose a color and take the 5 round wooden disks in that color, along with the 20 Track Ownership Locomotives of that color. Each player places a disk on the Engine Track in the "1 link" square. Each player places a disk on the Income Track in the "0" square.</p>

<p>Each player rolls 3 dice, the highest rolling player placing a disk in the "1st" place on the Player Order Track, the next highest placing a disk on the "2nd" place, and so on until each player has put a disk on the Player Order Track. Each player places a disk on the "2 shares" box of the Issues Shares Track and receives $10.</p>

<p>The fifth disk will be required for the Selected Actions display when the player chooses an Action. The game begins with the first step of the Sequence of Play, "Issue Shares".</p>

<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>The game ends when the last turn is completed. The number of turns played depends entirely upon the number of players and is denoted on the Turn Track shown on the Income Track display. For example, a 5 player game ends at the end of the seventh turn.</p>

<p>The player with the most Victory Points wins the game.</p>

<br>
<h2>Turn Overview</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>Issue Shares</li>
<li>Determine Player Order</li>
<li>Select Actions</li>
<li>Build Track</li>
<li>Move Goods</li>
<li>Collect Income</li>
<li>Pay Expenses</li>
<li>Income Reduction</li>
<li>Goods Growth</li>
<li>Advance Turn Marker</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h2>I. Issue Shares</h2>

<p>Players receive money in two ways, one being income received by the player's railroad, the second being when the player's railroad issues shares. When a player's railroad issues a share the player immediately receives $5 and advances that railroad's disk on the Issued Share Track (Ill.1) on the Income Track display.</p>

<p>More than one share may be issued in a turn, for each share issued, the player receives the corresponding multiple of $5 and advances that railroad's disk on the Issued Share Track on the Income Track display. A player may not issue more than 15 shares in the course of the game.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game2.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Shares are issued in Player Order, with the 1st player issuing shares, then the 2nd, until every player has had an opportunity to issue shares. A player is not required to issue any shares beyond the two with which they start the game.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Example:</b> At the start of a 3 player game, John issues two Shares, moves his disk to '4 shares' and receives $10. Dave issues one share, moves his disk to '3 shares' and receives $5. Pete issues no shares and his disk remains in the '2 Shares' box.</p>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>II. Determine Player Order</h2>

<p>Slide the disks on the Player Order Track (Ill. 2) upward, just above the printed circles. Players, starting with the 1st Player, will now bid for Player Order.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game3.jpg"><br><br>

<p>The 1st Player may bid $1 or more to stay in the bidding, or they may drop out of the bidding, putting their disk in the last position (for example, 5th in a game with five players) or, if they have chosen the Turn order action, they may say 'pass' once and remain in the bidding. $0 bids are not allowed.</p>

<p>The remaining players must either bid an amount greater than the last amount bid by another player or drop out or, if they had chosen the Turn order action, say 'pass' once to stay in the bidding.</p>

<p>Bidding continues until all but one player has dropped out of the bidding. The first player to drop out of the bidding takes the last player space on the Player Order Track and pays nothing, even if they had bid some amount.</p>

<p>The last two players participating in the bidding both pay the full amounts they had bid. Any other players pay half the amount they had bid, rounding up.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Example:</b> Pete was the 1st player, so he starts the bidding. Pete bids $2. Dave was the 2nd player in this five player game and says "I am dropping out". His disk is put in the 5th position on the Player Order Track. He pays nothing. Vince was the 3rd player and now bids $3. Hudson was the 4th player, he says "I am dropping out" and his disk is put in the 4th position on the Player Order Track.</p>

<p>He pays nothing as he bid nothing. John was the 5th player and had chosen the Turn order action. He chooses to exercise that action now and says "Pass". Bidding continues again with Pete, who says "I am dropping out". He puts his disk in the 3rd position and must pay half of what he bid, so he pays $1. Bidding continues with Vince. Vince had bid $3. He must either bid an amount greater than the last amount bid by another player or drop out. Since his last bid is higher than that bid by another player, Vince says "My $3 bid stands".</p>

<p>Now John must either top Vince's bid or drop out. He had already used the Turn order action so that option is no longer available to him. He decides to say "I am dropping out". He puts his disk in the 2nd position on the Player Order Track. He pays nothing, because he had bid no money, having only said "pass". Vince puts his disk in the 1st position on the player order track. He pays his $3 bid to the bank.</p>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>III. Select Actions</h2>

<p>Seven special Selected Actions (Ill. 3) are listed on the Goods/ Actions display. Players select Actions in Player Order. Each action may be selected by only one player.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game4.jpg"><br><br>

<h5>First Move Action:</h5>

<p><i>Implemented during the Move Goods phase.</i></p>

<p>The action allows this player to be the first player to move Goods, in both rounds of moving Goods, regardless of Player Order.</p>

<h5>First Build Action:</h5>

<p><i>Implemented during the Build Track phase.</i></p>

<p>This action allows this player to be the first player to build track, regardless of Player Order.</p>

<h5>Engineer Action:</h5>

<p><i>Implemented during the Build Track phase.</i></p>

<p>This action allows this player to build four track tiles instead of just three track tiles.</p>

<h5>Locomotive Action:</h5>

<p>Implemented immediately.</p>

<p>This action allows this player to immediately move their Links disk on the Engine Track up one link. The maximum number of Links is still 6.</p>

<h5>Urbanization Action:</h5>

<p><i>Implemented during the Build Track phase.</i></p>

<p>This action allows this player to place one of the New City tiles on a Town before they build their track.</p>

<h5>Production Action:</h5>

<p><i>Implemented during the Goods Growth phase.</i></p>

<p>This action allows this player, at the beginning of the phase, to randomly draw two Goods cubes from the bag and place them on any two empty boxes on the Goods Display, one cube per box.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> this action is pointless in the first turn of the game as there are no empty boxes.</p>

<h5>Turn Order (pass) Actions:</h5>

<p><i>Implemented during the Determine Player Order phase.</i></p>

<p>This action allows this player to say "pass", bidding nothing, once during the next Determine Player Order bidding phase.</p>


<br>
<h2>IV. Build Track</h2>

<h3>The Gameboard</h3>

<p>The gameboard is a hex map. The hex shaped Track tiles are placed on this hex map to build track, constructing railroad links joining the Cities and Towns on the map. Some hexes on the map show mountains (any hex with a rough texture) and rivers that increase the cost of placing a Track tile. The Great Lakes do not have hexes and Track tiles may not be placed on them.</p>

<h3>The Track Files</h3>

<p>The Track tiles have lines on them showing their track. The majority of Track tiles show a simple section of straight or curved track.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game6.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Some Track tiles are more complex, depicting two independent sections of track, either crossing</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game8.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Or simply coexisting on the tile.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game10.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Some Track tiles show a Town printed on them, these <b>Dedicated Town</b> Track tiles may only be placed on hexes with a Town, like Milwaukee.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game5.jpg"><br><br>

<p>When simple or complex track is placed in a Town hex, a Town counter, (white wooden disk), is placed on the center of the Track Tile. Towns connect all track into that Town.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game7.jpg"><br><br>

<p>8 New City tiles are also provided. A New City tile is placed by the player who has chosen the Urbanization action. A New City tile may only be placed on a hex with a Town.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game9.jpg"><br><br>

<h3>Building Track</h3>

<p>Track is built in Player Order. A player may place (or replace) up to 3 track tiles. A player who has chosen the Engineer action may place up to four track tiles. A player who has chosen the First Build action builds track before the 1st Player. Building track consists of placing a track tile or replacing an existing track tile.</p>

<p>The very first Track tile every player builds at the start of the game must be adjacent to a City and one end of the track on this simple Track tile must connect to the City. While City hexes do not show any track, they are considered to have connected track from each hexside to each other hexside.</p>

<p>All future track built by a player must ultimately connect to a City through that player's track.</p>

<p>Both simple and complex Track tiles may be placed in a Town hex. A Track tile placed on a Town must either be a dedicated Town Track tile or the Track tile must have a Town disk placed upon it.</p>

<p>Please note that a railroad is not required to have all its track connected together: separate, disconnected links and sections between Cities are possible.</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

<p>A Track tile may not be built so that the track runs off the grid, either off the end of the gameboard or into one of the Great Lakes. A Track tile may not be built so that the track directly connects to another player's track. A Track tile may not be built on a City hex.</p>

<h3>Completed Railroad Links and Unfinished Track Sections</h3>

<p>A group of Track tiles that connects a City or Town to another City or Town comprises a Completed Railroad Link. A group of Track tiles may not directly connect a City or Town to itself. A Track tile or group of Track tiles that does not connect a City or Town to another City or Town is an Unfinished Track Section.</p>

<h3>Track Ownership</h3>

<p>Track is owned by the building player and a Track Ownership Locomotive should be placed on the Completed Railroad Link or Unfinished Track Section built by the player to claim this ownership.</p>

<p>If an Unfinished Track Section is not extended by the player during their turn by placing a further Track tile, then their Track Ownership Locomotive is removed and the Unfinished Track Section becomes unowned. If another player extends that unowned, Unfinished Track Section they may claim ownership of the Track by placing one of their Track Ownership Locomotives on it. Redirection (see page 9) by itself is not an extension.</p>

<p>When an Unfinished Track Section is extended to a City or Town, this track becomes a Completed Railroad Link. The Track Ownership Locomotive on the link denotes ownership. Completed Railroad Links do not have to be extended to maintain a player's ownership of the link, the ownership is permanent.</p>

<blockquote class="radius">

<p><i>Example:</i> For his Build Track phase, Pete places track A for $2, track B for $2 and track C for $3 (See Track Building costs on page 10). Track C costs an extra dollar as it is the first track tile placed in that River terrain hex. Pete pays $7 for this Track Build. (Ill. 4)</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game11.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Pete places his black Track Ownership Locomotives on his track. Pete's track between Evansville and Cincinnati is a Completed Railroad Link. Pete's track from Cincinnati towards Lexington is an Unfinished Track Section. (Ill. 5)</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game12.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Dave builds track D for $2, builds track into and out of Indianapolis (E, using a straight track and putting a Town disk on it) for $3 and track F for $2. (Ill. 6)</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game13.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Dave places his yellow Track Ownership Locomotives on his track. Dave's track between the city of Evansville and town of Indianapolis is a Completed Railroad Link, as is his track between the city of Cincinnati and town of Indianapolis. (Ill. 7)</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game14.jpg"><br><br>

</blockquote>

<h3>Replacing Track</h3>

<p>A player may replace one Track tile with another Track tile for purposes of crossing, coexisting, redirection, or entering a Town.</p>

<p>Ignore any terrain features when replacing Track tiles, they do not increase the cost. A player may never modify existing track owned by another player, although they may replace a Track tile with another Track tile if they maintain existing track belonging to another player. The added new track must connect to the Player replacing the existing Track tile. Crossing</p>

<p>A player may replace a simple Track tile with a crossing track tile. Crossing track tiles have two independent sections of track crossing with a bridge. The tile must be placed so that it maintains existing track and the new track must connect to the placing player's existing track or a City.</p>

<h4>Coexisting</h4>

<p>A player may replace a simple Track tile with a coexisting track tile. Coexisting track tiles have two independent sections of track and have no bridge. The tile must be placed so that it maintains existing track and the new track must connect to the placing player's existing track or a City.</p>

<h4>Redirection</h4>

<p>A player may redirect a Track tile at the end of an unfinished Track Section with a different Track tile if they have ownership of the track or if it is unowned. Complex Track tiles must be redirected so that existing track owned by other players is maintained. Redirection is commonly done by players who have had their track "blocked" or "made difficult" by another player. Track in a Town may not be redirected, but usually may be upgraded to allow more connections.</p>

<h3>Entering A Town</h3>

<p>A player may replace a Track tile in a Town with another Track tile. The tile must be placed so that it maintains existing track.</p>

<blockquote class="radius">

<p><i>Example:</i> John builds track G for $3 (first tile on a River terrain hex), builds crossing track H for $3 and into and out of Indianapolis (J, using a Complex Crossing Track and putting a Town disk on it) for $3. (Ill. 8)</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game15.jpg"><br><br>

<p>John places his red Track Ownership Locomotives on his track. John's track between the town of Indianapolis and the city of Cincinnati is a Completed Railroad Link. John's track out of the town of Indianapolis is an Unfinished Track Section. (Ill. 9)</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game16.jpg"><br><br>

</blockquote>

<h3>Placing New City Tiles</h3>

<p>In his Build Track phase, the player who chose the Urbanization action places one of the New City tiles on any Town hex. The placement is free and the player may still build 3 Track. Remove any Track tile previously placed on the hex, if one exists. New Cities may not be placed on other New Cities.</p>

<blockquote class="radius">

<p><i>Example:</i> Vince chose the Urbanization action and replaces the town of Indianapolis with the New City A tile. John's Unfinished Track Section out of Indianapolis is obviated and his Track Ownership Locomotive is removed.</p>

<p>Vince places track K for $2, replaces track L for $3 and places track M for $3. (Ill. 10) Vince places his purple Track Ownership Locomotives on his track.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game17.jpg"><br><br>

</blockquote>

<h3>Track Building Costs</h3>

<h4>Placing</h4>

<p>Placing a Simple Track tile costs $2. If the hex the track tile is placed in has a river then the cost is $3. If the hex the track tile is placed in has a mountain then the cost is $4.</p>

<p>Placing a Complex Coexist Track tile costs $3. If the hex the track tile is placed in has a river then the cost is $4. If the hex the track tile is placed in has a mountain then the cost is $5.</p>

<p>Placing a Complex Crossing Track tile costs $4. If the hex the track tile is placed in has a river then the cost is $5. If the hex the track is placed in has a mountain then the cost is $6.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> the above mentioned additional costs are only incurred when the first tile is placed on the terrain, not when that tile is replaced or redirected.</p>

<p>Placing a Track tile in a Town costs $1 for the Town and $1 for every track to the Town. The least expensive Town tile is the Dedicated Town tile with one exit, which costs $2. The most expensive Town tile would be a Complex track with a Town disk placed on it. This would cost $5.</p>

<h4>Replacing</h4>

<p>Replacing a simple Track tile with a Complex Crossing Track tile always costs $3. (See Ill. 8) Replacing a Track tile in a Town costs $3, no matter the added connections. All other replacements cost $2.</p>

<h4>Redirecting</h4>

<p>Redirecting any track tile costs $2.</p>

<br>


<br>
<h2>V. Move Goods</h2>

<p>Players may move Goods (Goods=one cube) once, in Player Order, then complete a second round of moving Goods once again in Player Order. If a player has chosen the First Move action, they move Goods before the 1st Player.</p>

<p>The Goods must be moved along Completed Railroad Links so that the cube ends its movement at a City of the same color as the Goods and it may visit each City or Town only once. As soon as it enters a City with the same color as the Goods it must stop movement.</p>

<p>Goods can not be moved more than the number of Links allowed by that Player's disk on the Engine Track. (Ill. 11) Once the Goods have finished moving, the cube is returned to the bag of unused Goods.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game20.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Each different Completed Railroad Link the Goods travel over increases the income of the Completed Railroad Link's owner by 1 on the Income Track. This should be immediately recorded on the income track by moving the player's disk.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> a player's railroad income is recorded on a single track and past income is carried over from prior turns. Also note that a player can use another player's railroad, which would mean the owner of that link gains the increase on the Income Track. The only way a railroad's income decreases is either by insolvency (see Pay Expenses on page 12) or by market attrition.</p>

<p>In one of the two opportunities to Move Goods, the player may instead opt to move their disk on the Engine Track up one link. The maximum number of links is still 6 links.</p>

<p>In Ill. 12, Pete (black) is the 1st player but Dave (yellow) chose the First Move action so Dave moves Goods first. Instead of moving Goods, Dave instead chooses to advance his disk one link on the Engine track, from 1 link to 2 links. Pete is next and moves the blue Goods cube from Evansville over his single Completed Railroad Link to Cincinnati. His disk on the Income Track (Ill. 13) is moved up 1.</p>

<p>In the second round of Moving Goods, Dave moves the blue cube in Cincinnati two links, the first being from Cincinnati to the town of Indianapolis, the second link from Indianapolis to Evansville. His disk on the Income Track (Ill. 13) is moved up 2. Pete now has no Goods to move and doesn't want to increase his disk on the Engine track so he just declines to do anything.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game19.jpg"><br>

<br>
<h2>VI. Collect Income</h2>

<p>Players now receive the income shown by their disk on the Income Track (Ill. 13)</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game18.jpg"><br>

<br>
<h2>VII. Pay Expenses</h2>

<p>Players must now pay their expenses. Their expenses are $1 for every share they have issued (shown on the Issued Share Track) plus $1 for every Link their locomotives can traverse (shown on the Engine Track).</p>

<p>Each player must pay expenses with their cash. If they still owe expenses after paying all their cash they must reduce their income by one for every dollar they still owe. This should be immediately recorded on the Income Track by moving the player's disk.</p>

<p>If this causes a player to have less than $0 income, they are eliminated from the game (insolvency). Remove all their Track Ownership Locomotives on any Uncompleted Railroad Links. They are not paid when a player moves Goods over their Completed Railroad Links. Remove all their disks from the displays.</p>

<br>
<h2>VIII. Income Reduction</h2>

<p>If a player's railroad's income is over 50, that income is reduced by 10. If a player's railroad's income is 41-50, that income is reduced by 8. If a player's railroad's income is 31-40, that income is reduced by 6. If a player's railroad's income is 21-30, that income is reduced by 4. (Ill. 14) If a player's railroad's income is 11-20, that income is reduced by 2.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game21.jpg"><br>

<br>
<h2>IX. Goods Growth</h2>

<p>The Goods Growth phase takes Goods from the Goods Display (Ill. 15) and places them on Cities on the game board. The Goods Display is in two parts. The light section on the left, is done first. Then the dark section on the right, is done last.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game22.jpg"><br><br>

<p>If a player has chosen the Production action, they may randomly draw two Goods cubes from the bag and place them on any two empty boxes on the Goods Display, one cube per box, before the Goods Growth dice are rolled.</p>

<p>Then Roll as many dice as there were players at the start of the game. Put any 1's rolled above the '1' column, 2's above the '2' column and so on. A Goods cube is taken from the column indicated, from top to bottom, for each die rolled for that column and placed in that City on the map. Goods are placed in New Cities on the map, but not on New Cities that are not yet on the map.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>example: It is the second turn of a three player game and 3 dice are rolled: 3, 3, 4.</p>

<p>The cubes in column '3', boxes '1st' and '2nd' are placed in Kansas City. New City 'A' was placed during the Urbanization action in the Indianapolis hex, so it is on the map (Ill. 10). The cubes in column 'A', boxes '1st' and '2nd' are placed on the New City 'A' tile.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The first box in the '4' column, '1st' box is empty due to prior Goods Growth, so the cube in the '2nd' box is placed in Des Moines. New City 'B' is not yet on the map so no cube is moved to it.</p>

<p>If more dice are rolled for a City than the number of Goods in that City column then they are just excess dice.</p>

<br>
<h2>X. Advance Turn Marker</h2>

<p>Advance the Turn Marker on the Turn Track (Ill. 16) After the last turn, for example the 7th complete turn in a five player game, proceed to the Victory Point Computations (below). If it is not the last turn, return to the Issue Shares phase, and begin a new Turn.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/age-of-steam/game24.jpg"><br><br>

<h3>Victory Point Computations</h3>

<p>Players receive 3 Victory Points for every dollar of income shown on the Income Track. They receive 1 Victory Point for each section of Track that comprises part of a Completed Railroad Link. Sections of Track are denoted by the separations between Track tiles and between Cities and Towns.</p>

<p>Players lose 3 Victory Points for every share they issued as shown on the Issued Share Track. Money has no value at the end of the game, it was just a tool.</p>

<p>The player with the most Victory Points is the winner. Ties are possible. (See Ill. 17)</p>
