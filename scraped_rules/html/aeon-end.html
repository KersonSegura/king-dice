Just as a composer's creation is brought to life by the performing musicians, a game inventor's creation is brought to life by the players of the game.</p>

<p>When the creation is inspired and the players are talented, a true work of art results.</p>

<p>In creating the seven games in this book I have attempted to add a new visual dimension to the art of games. As each is played, a colorful drawing is formed. Because these drawings are reminiscent in style of the works of different modern masters of abstract art - some well known, others not so well - I have named the games in honor of the artists. â€¦</p></div></a><br class="break">
