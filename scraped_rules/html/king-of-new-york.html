<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>The goal of the game is to become King of New York. The game ends as soon as a Monster has earned 20 Victory Points (<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg">) or if it is the last Monster standing.</p>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Place the gameboard <s class="tokenlabel">1</s> in the middle of the table, accessible to all players. This represents the City of New York, comprising five distinct boroughs: Sta- ten Island, The Bronx , Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan (divided into three zones: Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan).</p>

<p>Shuffle all the cards <s class="tokenlabel">2</s> - except the two special cards - together to form a face-down deck. Put the top three cards of the deck face-up on the table near the deck and the tokens.</p>

<p>Place the two special cards, Statue of Liberty and Superstar, face-up beside the deck.</p>

<p>Place the tokens <s class="tokenlabel">3</s> beside the board. They will be used for certain card effects.</p>

<p>Put the six black dice <s class="tokenlabel">4</s> in the middle of the table. Keep the two green dice to the side (they're only used in certain circumstances).</p>

<p>Each player chooses a Monster, takes its figure <s class="tokenlabel">6</s> and its Monster board <s class="tokenlabel">5</s>, and sets the dials to 10 Life Points and 0 Victory Points. Form a pool of the Energy cubes <s class="tokenlabel">7</s>.</p>

<p>Shuffle all the Building tiles <s class="tokenlabel">8</s> together, and form stacks of three Buildings, Building-side- up. Place three of these stacks in each borough of New York. Don't look at the buildings below the top one; they will be revealed as the destruction ensues.</p>

<blockquote class="radius">

<h4>Tile Description</h4>

<p>Each tile depicts a Building on one side and a Unit on the other. These are things that the Monsters can destroy.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/game2.jpg"><br><br>

<p><b>Durability:</b> <s class="tokenlabel">1</s> The number of <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/d.jpg"> required to destroy it.</p>

<p><b>Reward:</b> <s class="tokenlabel">2</s> for destroying it.</p>

<p>If the tile you destroy is a Building, flip it over to its Unit side, and place it in the borough. If the tile you destroy is a Unit, remove it from the board.</p>

<p><img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/game3.jpg"> A Building with a durability of 1 always has an Infantry on its Unit side.</p>

<p><img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/game4.jpg"> A Building with a durability of 2 always has a Jet on its Unit side.</p>

<p><img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/game5.jpg"> A Building with a durability of 3 always has a Tank on its Unit side.</p>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>Players take turns in clockwise order.</p>

<p>To see who goes first, each player rolls the six black dice and the two green dice. Whoever rolls the most Attacks <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/a.jpg"> starts the game.</p>

<p>Starting with the first player, and going clockwise: Place your Monster in the borough of your choice, except Manhattan. There can be no more than two Monsters in any borough.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> From here on out, the rules and cards will refer to the players as Monsters.</p>

<p>On Your Turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll the Dice (up to 3 times)</li>
<li>Resolve the Dice (mandatory)</li>
<li>Move (generally optional, but sometimes mandatory)</li>
<li>Buy Cards (optional)</li>
<li>End Your Turn</li>
</ol>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/game6.jpg"><br><br>

<h3>1. Roll The Dice</h3>

<p>On your turn, roll the dice up to three times. For your first roll, you use the six black dice (you roll the green dice only when a card allows you to).</p>

<p>For your second and third rolls (both optional), you can reroll any or all of the dice (even ones that you chose to keep on a previous roll).</p>

<h3>2. Resolve The Dice</h3>

<p>After your final roll, the symbols on the dice indicate your actions for this turn.</p>

<p>You can resolve the dice in any order. However all dice of the same type must be resolved before resolving another type.</p>

<h3>3. Move</h3>

<p>If no one is in Manhattan you must move there. When you arrive in Manhattan, you must place your Monster on Lower Manhattan on the 2-4 space.</p>

<p>If another Monster is anywhere in Manhattan, you have two options: You can move to any borough that doesn't already have two Monsters in it (except Manhattan), or you can just stay in your borough.</p>

<p>If you were already in Manhattan, advance to the 2-4 space in the next zone up in Manhattan.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Once you are in Upper Manhattan, you no longer move during this phase. If you were already in Manhattan, you may not move to another borough (unless you have been damaged by another Monster's attack).</p>

<h3>4. Buy Cards</h3>

<p>After moving, you can buy one or more cards from those available.</p>

<p>You are also welcome to spend 2 Energy cubes (2 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/ee.jpg">) to discard the three available cards and three new ones.</p>

<p>You can buy and/or discard cards in any order you like, and as many times as you want, as long as you have the Energy cubes to do so.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/game8.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Each time you buy a card, immediately reveal a replacement for it from the deck.</p>

<p><i>Example:</i> Kong has 10 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/ee.jpg"> and doesn't like the cards currently available. He spends 2 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/ee.jpg"> to discard the three cards and reveal the next three. He still has and sees an interesting card that costs 3 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/ee.jpg">. He buys it and reveals a new card. He still has 5 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/ee.jpg"> which he decides to keep for another turn.</p>

<h3>5. End Your Turn</h3>

<p>Certain card effects activate during this phase.</p>

<p>This is the end of your turn. Pass the dice to the player on your left.</p>

<h2>Celebrity</h2>

</ul>

<h3>Ouch</h3>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/game18.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>If you roll at least <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg">, the military opens fire:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you rolled <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg">, the Units in your borough attack you. You take 1 damage per Unit tile in your borough.</li>
<li>If you rolled <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> , the Units in your borough attack all the Monsters in your borough (including you, of course). Each Monster in your borough takes 1 damage per Unit tile in your borough.</li>
<li>If you rolled <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> or more, all Units in the entire city attack. Each Monster takes 1 damage per Unit tile in his borough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, by rolling <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> or more, you trigger a counterattack by the entire army, and you become the defender of the city!</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty comes to life and teams up with you. Take the Statue of Liberty card and place it in front of you. As long as you have the Statue of Liberty card in front of you, you have an extra 3 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg">. You lose the extra 3 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg"> as soon as you lose the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<br>
<h2>Controlling Manhattan</h2>

<p>No Monsters start the game in Manhattan.</p>

<p>If there are no Monsters in Manhattan at the end of your turn, you must move into Manhattan.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The three zones of Manhattan - Lower, Midtown, and Upper - form a single borough. Therefore, there can be only one Monster in Manhattan, regardless of which zone it's in. Buildings and Units in Manhattan are accessible to the Monster in Manhattan regardless of zone. Similarly, <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/o.jpg"> allows Units in Manhattan to attack the Monster in Manhattan, regardless of zone.</p>

<p>If you are attacked while you are in Manhattan, you may flee Manhattan, to leave your place to the Monster that attacked you (he must move into Manhattan during his movement). You still take any damage he deals you. This is this only way you can leave Manhattan.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> A Discard card that directly damages you is not an attack. If an attack eliminates you while you are in Manhattan, the Monster that attacked you must move into Manhattan during his Move step.</p>

<h3>Effects Of Manhattan</h3>

<p>Being in Manhattan provides advantages and inconveniences:</p>
<ul>
<li>You earn 1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg"> when you seize control of Manhattan (-&gt;1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg">). Place your figure in Lower Manhattan.</li>
<li>At the start of your turn, you earn a number of <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg"> and <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/ee.jpg">, according to which zone of Manhattan you occupy: <ul><li>Lower = [+1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg">, +1 ]</li><li>Midtown = [+2 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg">, +1</li><li>Upper = [+2 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg">, +2 ]</li></ul></li>
<li>While in Manhattan, you cannot use <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/ll.jpg"> to heal, but it can still serve to trigger other game effects; and you can always use cards to heal yoursel.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the targets of your attacks are determined automatically by where you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are in Manhattan, your <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/a.jpg"> deals damage to all Monsters outside Manhattan.</li>
<li>If you are outside Manhattan, your <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/a.jpg"> deals damage to all Monsters in Manhattan.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p>The game ends at the end of a turn if a Monster has reached 20 Victory Points and survived, or if there is only one Monster still in the game. The Monster with 20 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-new-york/s.jpg"> or who is the last survivor wins the game and is crowned King of New York.</p>

<p>If all Monsters are eliminated in the same turn, nobody wins.</p>
