<p>Candy Land is a game of bright colors and pretty pictures made especially for little folks, many of whom are too young to read. It also includes features which make it an interesting game for older children.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Colorful Gameboard</li>
<li>4 Gingerbread Character Pawns</li>
<li>64 Cards</li>
<li>Rulebook</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>Travel through "Candy Land" along the path of colored spaces. The moves are made according to colored squares or picture cards drawn by the players.</p>

<p>Be the first player to reach the Candy Castle by loading on the multi-colored roinbow spoce at the end of the path.</p>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Open up the gameboard and place it on a flat surface. Shuffle the cards well. Place them in a pile face down within easy reach of all players.</p>

<p>Each player picks a Gingerbread Character pawn and ploces it on the START space on the gameboord.</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>The youngest player goes first. Play then passes to the left.</p>

<p>On your turn, draw one card from the deck and then move your Gingerbread Character pawn as directed below. Your turn is over. Place the card you used in 0 discard pile.</p>

<br>
<h2>Cards</h2>

<p>When you draw a cord with one color block, move your pawn forward toward the Candy Castle to the first matching color space on the path.</p>

<p>When you draw a cord with two color blocks, move your pawn forward toward the Candy Castle to the second matching color space on the path.</p>

<p>When you draw a Picture card, move your pawn forward or backward on the path to the pink picture space on the board that matches the PINK picture square on your card.</p>

<p>For example, if you draw a candy cane/mr. mint card, move your pawn to the pink space on the board that shows the candy cane.</p>

<br>


<br>
<h2>Movement</h2>
<ol>
<li>

<p>Always move in the direction of the signposts, unless 0 Picture cord directs you to move backwards on the path.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Two or more Gingerbread Character pawns may be on the some space at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h5>Shortcuts</h5>

<p>There are 2 shortcuts on the path - the Rainbow Trail and the Gumdrop Pass.</p>

<p>If your Gingerbread Character pawn lands, by exact count, on the orange space below the Rainbow Trail or on the yellow space below the Gumdrop Pass, you can take the shortcut immediately by moving your pawn to the purple space above the Rainbow Trail or to the green space above the Gumdrop Pass.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h5>Licorice Spaces</h5>

<p>There ore 3 Licorice Spaces on the path. These Licorice spaces were put here by the sneaky Lord Licorice to try to slow you down.</p>

<p>If you land on one of these spaces by exact count, your Gingerbread Character is stuck there for one turn.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Play as above until a player reaches the multi- colored rainbow space near the Candy Castle.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h4>Special Optional Rule for Younger Players</h4>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/candy-land/game1.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>Picture cards can only send players forward. They never send players back.</p>

<p>If you draw a Picture card that would send you backward along the path, discard the Picture card and draw a new card.</p>

<h4>Special Optional Rule for Older Players</h4>

<p>Once you've mastered the classic game, try this more challenging version. On each turn, draw TWO cords. Look at each card and choose which one you want to play.</p>

<p>Move your Gingerbread Character pawn accordingly, then discord both cards.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Hint:</b> This special rule helps children learn to make decisions as well as speeds up gameplay.</p>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p>If you are the first person to reach the multi-colored rainbow space, you've reached the Candy Castle and won the game.</p>
