<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Each player takes three pawns of one color and places them on their matching color start area. Shuffle the cards and place them face down in the center of the board.</p>

<p>The youngest player goes first. Play passes to the left.</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>On your turn:</p>

<div class="box blue_border">
<ol>
<li>

<p>Draw a card from the SORRY! deck and follow the instructions on the card.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Place the card face up on DISCARD HERE.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>If you run out of cards to draw, reshuffle the discard pile and place them face down in the center of the board.</p>

</li>
</ol>

</div>

<br>

<h3>Starting a Pawn</h3>

<p>Any forward-moving card can move a pawn out of its start area.</p>

<br>

<h3>Moving Around the Board</h3>

<p>Pawns move clockwise around the board, unless a card instructs them otherwise.</p>

<h4>Jumping and Bumping</h4>

<p>You may jump over your own or another player's pawn if it is in your way, counting it as one space.</p>

<p>But, if you land on a space that's already occupied by an opponent's pawn, bump that pawn back to its own color start area and take the space!</p>

<br>

<h4>Occupied Spaces</h4>

<p>Only one of your pawns may occupy a space at a time, except for the start area or home.</p>

<p>If your only possible move would require you to land on a space already occupied by one of your other pawns, you forfeit your turn.</p>

<p>If at any time you cannot move, you forfeit your turn. But if you can move, you must move, even if it is not to your advantage!</p>

<br>


<br>
<h2>Rules of the Board</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/sorry/game2.jpg"><br><br>

<div class="box green_border">
<ul>
<li>

<h4>Slide</h4>

<p>Any time you land by exact count on the triangle at the beginning of a slide that shows your color, slide ahead to the end and bump any pawns in your way − including your own! − back to their own start areas.</p>

<p>If you land on a slide that does not show your color, don't slide, just stay put on the triangle.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4>Safety Zone</h4>

<p>Only you may enter your own color safety zone. All other rules apply. No pawn may enter its safety zone by a backward move. However, a pawn may move backward out of its safety zone.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4>Safety Zone Entry Space</h4>

<p>When moving along the outside track, you may not move your pawn forward past your own safety zone entry. However, you may pass the entry space on a backward move (4 or 10 card).</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4>Home</h4>

<p>You must bring all three of your pawns into home by exact count. Once home, do not move that pawn again for the rest of the game.</p>

</li>
</ul>
