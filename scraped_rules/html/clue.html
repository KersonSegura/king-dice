<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>

<p>Take that Suspect token and place it on the assigned starting space.</p>

<p>If fewer than 6 are playing, be sure to place the remaining tokens onto the appropriate names because they might be involved in the crime!</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Place each of the weapons ad random in a room.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Sort the cards by type into three groups: Suspects, Rooms and Weapons.</p>

<p>Shuffle each group face-down, draw one card from each group and slide them into the "Case File Confidential" envelope. Place it onto the "X" in the center of the board.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Shuffle the three piles of remaining cards together and deal them face down clockwise around the table.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>If you wish, check out the cards that are in your hand. You can also cross them off in your notebook as possibility.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/clue/object.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Mr. Boddy is found death in one of the rooms of his mansion.</p>

<p>The players must determine the answers to these three questions: Who killed him? Where? and with What Weapon?</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>Miss Scarlett opens the game, the turns continue clockwise around the table.</p>

<p>On each turn, a player try to reach a different room of the mansion to investigate.</p>

<p>To start your turn, move your token by rolling the die or use a Secret Passage when you are in a corner room.</p>

<p>If you roll the die, you move your token that many spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontally or vertically, forward or backward, but not diagonally.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to enter the same space twice on the same turn.</li>
<li>You may not enter on a space that is already occupied by another player.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you move through a Secret Passage, you don't need to roll and you can move immediately to the other room. This ends your movement.</p>

<p>It is possible that your opponents might block any and all doors and trap you in a room. In that case, you have to wait for someone to move or un-block a door to leave!</p>

<br>
<h2>Suggestions</h2>

<p>When you enter a room, you can make a suggestion by naming a suspect, murder weapon and the room you just entered.</p>

<p>e.g. "The crime was committed by Mr. Green in the lounge with a knife".</p>

<p>The named suspect and weapon are moved into the room you entered.</p>

<p>Then your opponents (starting by the left player) must (if possible) prove that your suggestion is false by showing you one card that matches your suggestion.</p>

<p>If the first player can't disprove, the next player must try it, etc... until all players have passed.</p>

<p>As soon as someone shows you one of the cards, it is prooved that it can't be in the envelope and you can cross it off in your notebook as a possibility.</p>

<p>If no one is able to prove your suggestion false, you may either end your turn or make an accusation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Note:</b> the suggestion is always made for the room your token is at that moment.</p>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>Accusing</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/clue/clue-enveloppe.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>If you think you have solved the crime (by deduction), you can end your turn by making an accusation and name any three elements.</p>

<p>you can say: "I accuse (suspect) of committing the crime in the (room) with the (weapon)".</p>

<p>Then, you must look secretly at the cards in the envelope to check if your suggestion is correct.</p>

<p>If you are correct, you can place the 3 cards face-up on the table to prove it and you won the game!</p>

<br>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Note:</b> You can only make one accusation during a game. If your accusation is wrong, you lost and you must leave the game (and board).</p>
