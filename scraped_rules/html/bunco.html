<p>Bunco is a light-hearted, friendly game of rolling three dice. It's fun to ring the bell each time a "Bun- co" is rolled or when a player reaches "21".</p>

<p>You'll find everything you need to play Bunco in this package-9 dice (3 of each color-red, white and blue), a two-sided score pad and a silver-toned game bell.</p>

<p>A full Bunco party with 12 players is loads of fun; rules for Party Bunco are included. And for the many times when fewer Bunco players are present, rules are provided for 2-11 players as well!</p>

<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>To have the highest score at the end of six rounds of play.</p>

<br>
<h2>Bunco Terms</h2>

<p><b>Bunco:</b> A three-of-a-kind of the number that cor- responds to the round (three "1's" in Round One, three "2's" in round Two and so on). This is often called a "true" Bunco. A true Bunco immediately ends the round and scores 21 points.</p>

<table class="image-description"><tbody><tr><td><img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game1.jpg"><br>Bunco for Round Four</td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p><b>Low Bunco:</b> A three-of-a-kind that is lower than the number of the round (3's, 2's or 1's rolled during round 4, for instance). Low Buncos score 7 points.</p>

<table class="image-description"><tbody><tr><td><img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game2.jpg"><br>A Low Bunco during Rounds Three, Four, Five or Six</td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p><b>High Bunco:</b> A three-of-a-kind that is higher than the number of the round (5's or 6's rolled during Round Four, for instance). High Buncos score 5 Points.</p>

<table class="image-description"><tbody><tr><td><img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game3.jpg"><br>A High Bunco during Rounds One, Two, Three or Four</td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p><b>Set:</b> Six complete rounds (rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6)</p>

<br>


<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<blockquote>

<h2>One Table Bunco</h2>

</blockquote>

<p><i>(For 2-4 players)</i></p>

<p>All players sit around one table. If 2 or 3 are playing, each can retain and roll the three dice of one color. If four are playing, select the dice of one color for all to share. When four are playing, all four players use these dice, passing them from player to player.</p>

<p>Appoint a scorekeeper who will record scores on both sides of the score sheet. Place the bell in a location where all can reach it.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game14.jpg"><br><br>

<p>In each round, players hope to roll the same number as the number of the round (for example in Round One, the target number is 1). No other number will score (except when a Low Bunco or High Bunco is rolled).</p>

<p>The scorekeeper begins by ringing the bell to signify the start of the round. This player then rolls all three dice and looks to see if any of them come up "I".</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>Anytime a player rolls the round's number (in this case "1") she scores 1 point for each die showing this number and rolls again.</p>

<blockquote class="radius">

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game5.jpg"><br><br>

<p>For example, on her first roll in Round One, a player rolls two "4's" and one "1". She scores 1 point for the "1" and may roll again.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game6.jpg"><br><br>

<p>If she then rolls two more "1's", she scores two more points.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game7.jpg"><br><br>

<p>If she rolls three "1's" she has rolled a true Bunco and scores 21 points. The bell is rung, everyone shouts "Bunco" and the round is over!</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game9.jpg"><br><br>

<p>In Round One this throw would end a player's turn because no "1" was rolled.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>

<p>Whenever a player fails to roll at least one of the current round's number, her turn immediately ends and the dice are passed to the player on the left. This player then takes her turn. Play contin- ues in this manner until one player accumulates 21 points and wins the round.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Bonus Points</h2>

<p>Whenever a Low Bunco or High Bunco is rolled, the player immediately scores bonus points (7 points for a Low Bunco, 5 for High Bunco-see "Bunco Terms").</p>

<p>The round continues and the player rolls again. The round ends, as usual, when a player accumulates 21 points.</p>

<p>For example, during Round Four a player rolls three "2's". Since "2" is lower than the round's number, she has rolled a "low Bunco" and scores 7 points. If during Round Four she rolls three "5's", she has rolled a High Bunco (5 is higher then the round's number) and scores 5 points.</p>

<h4>Scoring</h4>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game15.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>On the Rounds side of the score sheet, the score- keeper writes the initials of each player in the spaces atop the columns for the round being played. When- ever a player scores points, the scorekeeper writes the score in her column.</p>

<p>A player is always entitled to ask the scorekeeper how many points she has accumulated. The scorekeeper announces when a player reaches or surpasses 21 points. The round ends. This player rings the bell to celebrate her win!</p>

<table class="image-description"><tbody><tr><td><img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game11.jpg"><br>LL accumulates 21 points and wins the round.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p>On the Master Score Sheet side, the scorekeeper re- cord's the round's results. (Each player's name should be written on a line). The player who won Round One gets a "W" recorded in her row in column #1. If this player has rolled a true Bunco, a "B" is also recorded.</p>

<table class="image-description"><tbody><tr><td><img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game12.jpg"><br>Laura wins this game by virtue of a tiebreaker</td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<br>
<h2>Starting the Next Round</h2>

<p>The player to the left of the round's winner picks up the dice and rolls first to start Round #2. Play contin- ues until a full "Set" has been played (all six rounds).</p>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p>When the Set ends, the player with the most "W's" wins the game.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If this is a tie, the player with the most "B's", among those in the tie, wins the game.</p></li>

<li><p>If this is still a tie, a "roll off" breaks the tie.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In a roll off, the first player to reach 5 points wins the roll off (points are scored for rolling the number of the round just completed, as well as for Buncos). To determine who goes first in a roll-off, each player rolls all three dice. High total will roll first ( but does not score for this roll).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> for a quicker game, make 11 points the goal to win each round.</p>

<br>


<blockquote>

<h2>Party Bunco</h2>

</blockquote>

<p><i>(for 12 players)</i></p>

<p>Bunco is a lot of fun to play when a full compliment of 12 players are present. Players will move from table to table after each round.</p>

<p>The bell is rung often. Prizes may be awarded (everyone chips in to cover the cost), and it is always a good idea to take breaks after each Set to serve party food or snacks.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game17.jpg"><br>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Three tables, each equipped with one score sheet, pencil, three dice. The bell is placed on the "head" table. Only the Master Score Sheet at the head table will be used during play. The scorekeeper seated at this table for Round One should enter the names of all twelve players on the sheet.</p>

<p>Players sit four to a table. The person sitting across from you is your teammate. The Rounds sheet at each table will be used to record scores during each of the six rounds at that table.</p>

<p>The current table's scorekeeper enters the initials of each player atop the scoring columns for the round to be played.</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>A player at the head table rings the bell to begin the first round. The scorekeeper at each table rolls first. Play is just like in "One Table Bunco" (players at each table attempt to roll the current round's number). However, players sitting opposite are temporary teammates and their scores are added together.</p>

<br>
<h2>Winning a Round</h2>

<p>The round ends whenever one team accumulates 21 combined points between it's two players. The scorekeeper announces the winners and the bell is rung at the head table to honor this team.</p>

<p>The other tables keep playing until there is a winning team at each table (ring the bell as each table win- ner is declared). Ring the bell three times to declare the round over after the third table completes the round.</p>

<p>Whenever a true Bunco is rolled at any table, the roll- ing players shouts out "Bunco!", the bell is rung three times, and the round ends at ALL tables. The team with the most points at each other table is declared table winner. If there is a tie, hold a roll off until one team scores 5 points.</p>

<table class="image-description"><tbody><tr><td><img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game13.jpg"><br>"AJ" and teammate "LL" combine<br>to score 21 and win the round.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<br>
<h2>The Master Score Sheet</h2>

<p>The scorekeeper at Table One enters, on the Master Score Sheet, the results for all players for the just- completed round. A "W" is entered for each member of the winning team at each table: there will be six "winners" in all.</p>

<p>Only the player who rolls a true Bunco gets a "B" recorded in her scoring row (not her partner).</p>

<br>
<h2>Moving to your new table</h2>

<p>Once scores are tallied, players move. The two win- ing players at each table remain, but one of them shifts to a vacant chair at the table, in order to create all-new teams in the next round.</p>

<p>The losing team from each table now moves-those from Table One move to the vacant chairs at Table Two; those from Table Two move to Table Three; those from Table Three move to Table One.</p>

<br>
<h2>The Next Round</h2>

<p>The head table rings the bell to begin Round Two.</p>

<p>The scorekeeper at each table rolls first, as usual. Continue playing until a full Set is completed. The winner of the Set is the player with the most "W's". If there is a tie, it is broken by the same procedure as in One Table Bunco.</p>

<p>For a longer party, take a break, serve some food, and then play a second Set. (Many Bunco parties go on for a third and final Set, as well). Feel free to copy the score sheets, if you run out, or visit winning-moves.com to download more for free!</p>

<h2>Bunco</h2>

</blockquote>

<p><i>(for 5 To 11 Players)</i></p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/bunco/game18.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>Play is the same as for Party Bunco, except as noted below (mainly to accommodate and odd number of players). Whenever players are part of a team, their goal remains to score a combined 21 points.</p>

<p>When playing as individuals, their goal is to accumulate 11 points, to win the round at their table.</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>When five play, seat three at one table and two at the second table.</p>

<p>Players play for themselves, there are no teams. Both players at Table Two move to Table One while the two losing players at Table One move to Table Two. (Only the winner at Table One doesn't move).</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Note:</b> when 6-11 play, move after the end of a round according to these guidelines.</p>
<ol>
<li>The winning team at Table One remains, with one player changing chairs.</li>
<li>The others move according to the instructions below.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>

<p>When six play, seat 4 players at Table One and 2 at Table Two. Those at Table One play in teams. Those at Table Two play as individuals.</p>

<p>At the end of each round, the losing team at Table One goes to Table Two and plays against each other. Both players from Table Two move to Table One.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>When seven play, the four players at Table One form teams while the three at Table Two play as individuals. When moving, both losing players from Table One move to Table Two; both losing players from Table Two move to Table One.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>When eight play, there are two tables of four playing in teams.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>When nine play, Table One will have 4 players playing in teams; Table Two will have 3 players playing as individuals and Table Three will have 2 playing as individuals.</p>

<p>When moving, both players at Table Three move to Table One; the losing players at Table One move to Table Two and those from Table Two move to Table Three.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>When ten play, teams are formed at Tables One and Two while two players play as individual s at Table Three. (Follow moving rules for nine players).</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>When eleven play, teams are formed at Tables One and Two and the three remaining players play as individual s at Table Three. When moving, the losing players at each table move. The winners remain.</p>

</li>
</ul>
