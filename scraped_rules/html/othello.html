<h2>Game Components</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>A square 8x8 board (you could use a chess board)</p></li>

<li><p>64 discs coloured black on one side and white on the opposite side.</p></li>

</ul>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/othello/board1.jpg" class="floatl">

<p>The board will start with 2 black discs and 2 white discs at the centre of the board.</p>

<p>They are arranged with black forming a North-East to South-West direction.</p>

<p>White is forming a North-West to South-East direction.</p>

<br>

<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>The goal is to get the majority of colour discs on the board at the end of the game.</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player plays black and the other white.</p>

<p>Each player gets 32 discs and black always starts the game.</p>

<p>Then the game alternates between white and black until:</p>

<ul>
<li>one player can not make a valid move to outflank the opponent.</li>
<li>both players have no valid moves.</li>

</ul>

<p>When a player has no valid moves, he pass his turn and the opponent continues.</p>

<p>A player can not voluntarily forfeit his turn.</p>

<p>When both players can not make a valid move the gane ends.</p>

<br>
<h2>Valid Moves</h2>

<p>Black always moves first.</p>

<p>A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in a position that "out-flanks" one or more of the opponent's discs.</p>

<p>A disc or row of discs is outflanked when it is surrounded <b><i>at the ends</i></b> by discs of the opposite color.</p>

<p>A disc may outflank any number of discs in one or more rows in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).</p>

<p>For example: a white piece is being placed on the board that creates a straight line made up of a white piece at either end and only black pieces in between.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/othello/board2.jpg" class="floatl">

<p>White places in the illustration a disc on E3.</p>

<p>The black discs on E4, E5 and E6 are now outflanked by the white disc on E3 and the white disc on E7.</p>

<p>The black discs will be flipped to white.</p>

<br>

<p>All the discs which are outflanked will be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip them.</p>

<p>Discs may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the disc being played.</p>

<p>If you can't outflank and flip at least one opposing disc, you must pass your turn. However, if a move is available to you, you can't forfeit your turn.</p>

<p>Once a disc has been placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game.</p>

<p>When a player runs out of discs, but still has opportunities to outflank an opposing disc, then the opponent must give the player a disc to use.</p>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p>When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over.</p>

<p>The discs are now counted and the player with the majority of his or her color discs on the board is the winner.</p>

<p>A tie is possible.</p>

<br>

<h3>Time Limit</h3>

<p>Players can start with a preset time limit for their total number of moves. This timing element adds more pressure to the game.</p>

<p>The clock will start counting down at the beginning of a player's first move and be paused each time they complete a turn whilst the opposing player's clock is ticking down.</p>

<p>There are varying time limits ranging from 5 minutes up to 30 minutes as seen in the world championship rules.</p>

<p>When one player's clock runs out of time, no matter what the position or number of chips on the board, that player looses the game.</p>

<br>

<h3>Handicaps</h3>

<p>Because there is an advantage in starting first, the more experienced player should give this advantage to the less experienced player.</p>

<p>When a very skilled player is playing against an unskilled player, then the skilled player may take on a handicap by setting up the board to give his weaker opponent a four corner advantage.</p>

<p>If the difference in skill is not so big, then one, two or three corner advantages can be given.</p>
