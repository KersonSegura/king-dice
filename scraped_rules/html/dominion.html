<h2>The Supply</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/dominion/cards1.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>Prepare the supply:</p>

<p>Place the 3 treasure piles in a row on the table.</p>

<p>Next to them, place the victory cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p><b>For two players:</b> Place eight of each of these Victory cards in the supply.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>For three or four players:</b> Place 12 of each of these victory cards instead</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Place also 10 curse cards to the place for a two player game, 20 curse cards for three players and 30 curse cards for four players.</p>

<p>Finally, choose 10 Kingdom cards and place then in the Supply. It is useful to arrange them in ascending order of purchase cost.</p>

<p>Players may also use the Randomizer cards as placeholders. Put all unused Victory cards back in the box.</p>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Each player starts with 10 cards: 7 copper and 3 estates as a starting deck. The estates come from the remainder in the box.</p>

<p>Each player shuffles their deck, draws five cards and the game can start.</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>At random, the starting player is choosen. When multiple games are played, then the starting player will be the player left of the last winner. If there was a tie, the again a random player will be choosen.</p>

<p>A turn consists of 3 phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<h4>Action</h4>

<p>The player may play one action card from his hand.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4>Buy</h4>

<p>The player may buy a card in a pile on the table.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4>Cleanup</h4>

<p>The player must discard all played and unplayed cards back to the discard pile and draw again 5 new cards.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h2>Action Phase</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/dominion/villa.jpg" width="150" class="floatr">

<p>The player may play one action cards. These are the Kingdom cards that say: "Action" at the bottom of the card.</p>

<p>Players don't start with any Action cards, so during the first 1 turns no Actions can be performed.</p>

<p>Normally a player can play only one card, but some action cards allow the player to play more cards.</p>

<p>To play a card, the player lays the action card face-up in his play area. He announces which card he is playing and follows the instructions written on that card from top to bottom.</p>

<p>The player may still play the Action card even when he is not able to do everything listed.</p>

<p>Any action cards played remain in the player's play area until the Clean-up phase of the turn unless otherwise indicated on the card.</p>

<p>The action phase ends when the player cannot or chooses not to play any more Action cards.</p>

<br>
<h2>Buy Phase</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/dominion/plunder.jpg" width="150" class="floatr">

<p>The player can gain one card from the Supply by paying its cost. The cost of a card is found in the lower left corner.</p>

<p>Any card in the Supply maybe be bought, but the player may not purchase cards from the Trash Pile. When a player played a certain card in his Action phase, its possible that he is allowed to buy more than one card.</p>

<p>The player places the purchased card from the Supply pile face-up on his Discard pile. The ability of the purchased card may not be used when he just gain the card.</p>

<p>The treasure cards remain in the play area until the Clean-up phase. Treasure cards will be used multiple times during the game. Treasure cards are a source of income, not a resource that is used up when played.</p>

<p>Coppers are worth 1 coin, Silvers are worth 2 coins and Golds are worth 3 coins.</p>

<br>
<h2>Clean-up Phase</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/dominion/hand.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>All cards gained are already in the player's discard pile. The player places also all his cards (played and unplayed) to this pile.</p>

<p>The player now draws a new hand of 5 cards from his Deck. If there are not enough cards in his Deck, he draws as many as he can.</p>

<p>The player shuffles then his Discard pile to form a new face-down Deck, and then draws the rest of his new hand.</p>

<p>Once the player has drawn a new hand of 5 cards, the next player starts his turn.</p>

<p>To speed up play, players may begin their turns while the previous players are completing their clean-up phases, but when someone plays an Attack card, the players must complete their Clean-up phases first in order to resolve the Attack.</p>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p>The game ends when the last Province is bought, or when 3-4 piles are empty. The players will count their victory points in their decks and the player with the most points wins.</p>

<p>If there is a tie, then the player with the fewest turns wins.</p>
