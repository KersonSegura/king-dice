<p>This delightful game is simple and easy to play, even for children who can't read. Fun pictures help kids understand the rewards of doing good deeds as they climb up the ladders and the consequences of naughty ones as they slide down the chutes.</p>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Position the gameboard so all the players can easily move their pawns from square to square</p>

<p>Everyone chooses a pawn to play. Any extra pawns are out of play. Chosen pawns start off the board near square #1. Now get ready for the fun!</p>

<br>

<h4>All about the squares:</h4>

<p>Take a peek at the gameboard. The squares are numbered from 1 to 100. Players' pawns will move back and forth across the board, following the numbers upward - starting at square #1 and moving right toward square #10, then up to lt square #11 and left toward square #20, etc.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also move up by climbing ladders and sometimes go down, too, by sliding down chutes. More about that later.</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>Everyone spins the spinner. The player with the highest number goes first. Play proceeds to the left.</p>

<h4>What to do on your turn:</h4>

<p>On your turn, spin the spinner and move your pawn, square by square, the number shown on the spinner. For example, on your first turn, if you spin a 5, move to square #5 on the board. Once you move your pawn, your turn is over.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Two or more pawns may be on the same space at the same time.</p>

<h3>Going up a ladder or down a chute</h3>

<h4>Ladders</h4>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/chutes-and-ladders/game5.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>Any time a pawn ends its move on a picture square at the bottom of a ladder, that pawn must climb up to the picture square at the top of the ladder.</p>

<p>For example, if you end your move on square #9, you can immediately move up to square #31.</p>

<p>Notice that the pictures on these two squares are related. The little boy who mows the lawn is rewarded for his job with a trip to the circus.</p>

<h4>Chutes</h4>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/chutes-and-ladders/game6.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>Any time a pawn ends its move on a picture square at the top of a chute, that pawn must slide down the chute to the picture square at the bottom of the chute.</p>

<p>For example, if you end your move on square #49, you must immediately move down to square #11. Again, the pictures are related. Eating too many cookies can give you a tummy-ache!</p>

<p>If your pawn ends its turn on any of the following spaces, your turn is over:</p>
<ul>
<li>a square with no picture</li>
<li>a square with no picture and just an arrow</li>
<li>a square that a ladder or chute just passes through</li>
<li>a picture square at the top of a ladder</li>
<li>a picture square at the bottom of a chute</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<div class="box blue_border">

<p>The first player to reach the "Winner" square #100 wins the game. You can get there 2 ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Land there by exact count. If your spin would take you past square 100, don't move. Try again on your next turn.</p></li>

<li><p>Climb there by ending your move on ladder square 80.</p></li>
</ol>
