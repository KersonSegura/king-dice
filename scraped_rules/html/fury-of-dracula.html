<p>Fury of Dracula is a one-versus-many deduction game inspired by Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula. One player controls Dracula, and up to four players assume roles as hunters. During the game, Dracula attempts to elude the hunters as he spawns new vampires across Europe, while the hunters try to find and destroy Dracula and end his reign of terror.</p>

<p>When setting up a game of Fury of Dracula, players perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<p><b>Place Game Board:</b> Unfold the game board and place it in the center of the play area within reach of all players.</p>
</li>
<li>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game6.jpg" class="floatr">

<p><b>Set Influence Track:</b> Place the influence marker on space "0" of the influence track.</p>

<br class="break">

<br>
</li>
<li>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game7.jpg" class="floatr">

<p><b>Set Time Track:</b> Place the time marker on the yellow Monday (day) space on the time track.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Assign roles:</b> One player chooses to control Dracula; he should sit near the side of the board showing the trail. The remaining players each choose a hunter to control. Each player takes a character sheet and figure, each hunter takes one hunter reference card, and Dracula takes the reference map.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game8.jpg"><br><br>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Prep are Hunter cards:</b> Shuffle all item cards and place them facedown near the board (5a). Then, shuffle both the hunter and Dracula event cards together into a single deck and place it near the item deck (5b). Sort the hunter combat cards by type and place them in three distinct piles near the item deck (5c).</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Prepare Dracula cards:</b> Sort the encounter cards (6a) and Dracula combat cards (6b) into two separate decks and individually shuffle them. Then, create the location deck (6c) by organizing the location cards numerically. Place all three decks facedown near Dracula's side of the board.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Create Token Pool:</b> Place the ticket tokens facedown near the board and randomize them. Then, separate the remaining tokens by type and place them in piles near the board.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Draw Encounter cards:</b> Dracula draws five encounter cards for his starting hand.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Place Hunters:</b> Each hunter places his figures on a city on the board. Lord Godalming is placed in Constanta <s class="tokenlabel">A</s>, Dr. John Seward is placed in Marseilles <s class="tokenlabel">B</s>, Mina Harker is placed in Brussels <s class="tokenlabel">C</s>, and Van Helsing is placed in Amsterdam <s class="tokenlabel">D</s>. When playing the advanced game, each hunter chooses his starting city.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game9.jpg"><br><br>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Choose Dracula's Starting location:</b> Dracula chooses a starting location. Instead of placing his figure on the board, he secretly searches his location cards for the card matching the location where he wishes to start. Then, he places that card facedown on the first space (leftmost space) of the trail.</p>

<p>Dracula cannot choose a sea zone, Castle Dracula, or a city that a hunter occupies as his starting location. After placing a location card, Dracula places his figure on the red circle near the first space of the trail <s class="tokenlabel">E</s>.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<h4>Fewer than five Players</h4>

<p>If there are three hunter players, one player controls two hunters. If there are two hunter players, each player controls two hunters. If there is one hunter player, that player controls all four hunters.</p>

<br>

<h4>Players as Hunters or Dracula</h4>

<p>When playing Fury of Dracula, each player controls one character-one of the hunters or Dracula. When a rule or effect refers to either a hunter or Dracula, it is referring to both the player and the character (hunter or Dracula) that player controls.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/hunters.jpg"><br>

<br>

<h4>A Guide For New Hunters</h4>

<p>Hunters should focus on tracking down and killing Dracula. Doing so takes time and cooperation. During the early part of the game, hunters should use actions to move around the map, hoping to find a location that is on Dracula's trail.</p>

<p>It is helpful for hunters to spread out to cover more ground. While hunters move around during the early part of the game, they should gather as many useful items, events, and ticket tokens as possible so that, when they are closer to finding Dracula's location later the game, they can efficiently corner him and defeat him.</p>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>During Fury of Dracula, the hunters play as a team and win or lose the game together.</p>

<p>The hunters are searching for Dracula as he travels through Europe in secret. Dracula's objective is to advance the influence track to space "13" by creating new vampires and defeating the hunters.</p>

<p>The hunters' objective is to find and defeat Dracula before his influence engulfs Europe.</p>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>Fury of Dracula is played over a series of game rounds. Each round consists of a hunter phase followed by a Dracula phase. Rounds continue until the game ends.</p>

<br>
<h2>Hunter Phase</h2>

<p>Each hunter phase contains both day and night. During day, hunters can move around Europe and search for Dracula. During night, hunters can investigate and prepare for the upcoming day.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game10.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>First, each hunter performs one action during day. Then, each hunter performs one action during night. Players perform actions in numerical order according to the activation order number that is printed on the upper-left corner of each character sheet.</p>

<p>There are seven different actions a hunter can perform. Each hunter reference cards provides a brief description of these action. Hunters perform actions as follows:</p>

<h3>1. Move Action</h3>

<p>When a hunter performs a move action, he moves his figure on the board to indicate his new location, which must be either a city or a sea zone (see "What Are Locations?"). Hunters can only perform move actions during day.</p>

<p>A hunter may move by road, railway, or sea, as follows:</p>

<p><b>Road:</b> A hunter can move from one city to an adjacent city (see "What Are Roads and Railways?").</p>

<p><b>Railway:</b> If a hunter has a ticket token, he can spend it to move by railway. He uses a value on the spent ticket token to determine how many railways he can use to move to a new city. This is described in detail later.</p>

<p><b>Sea:</b> If a hunter is in a port, he can move to an adjacent sea zone. If a hunter is in a sea zone, he can move to either an adjacent port or an adjacent sea zone. If a hunter is in a sea zone during day, he must move. If a hunter is in a sea zone during night, he must pass.</p>

<h3>What Are Locations</h3>

<p>There a two types of locations on the game board: cities and sea zones.</p>

<p>Each city has a name and is either a large or small city. Some cities are also ports. Each port is adjacent to a sea zone and has an anchor icon to indicate this.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game11.jpg"><br><br>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game12.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>Sea zones are spaces on the board that are divided by borders. Two sea zones that share a border are adjacent.</p>

<br>

<h4>What are Roads and Railways?</h4>

<p>Roads and railways are lines that connect cities to other cities. If two cities are connected by one road, they are adjacent. In the diagram, the two large cities are not adjacent to each other, but are both adjacent to the small city.</p>

<p>Each railway connects one city to another city. Hunters can use railways to move greater distances or between cities that are not adjacent. In the diagram, a hunter can move by railway to move between the two large cities even though they are not adjacent.</p>

<br>

<blockquote class="white">

<h3>Hunter Movement Example</h3>

<p>It is day, and the hunters perform actions in turn order:</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game14.jpg"><br><br>

<ol>
<li><p>Lord Godalming is in Toulouse, and he chooses to move by road. There are several cities adjacent to Toulouse, and he chooses to move to Barcelona.</p></li>

<li><p>Dr. Seward is in Marseilles, and he chooses to move by railway. He spends one of his ticket tokens that has a "3/2" on it. He chooses to move to Cologne, which is three railways away.</p></li>

<li><p>Van Helsing is in Genoa, which is a port. He chooses to move by sea, so he moves to the Tyrrhenian Sea.</p></li>

<li><p>Mina Harker had moved from the Mediterranean Sea to the Tyrrhenian Sea during the previous hunter phase. During day, she must move by sea. She chooses to move to the adjacent port city of Rome.</p></li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<h3>2. Supply Action</h3>

<p>To prepare for the deadly, inevitable confrontation with the Count, the hunters need to gather supplies by drawing item and event cards.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game15.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>If a hunter performs a supply action in a large city, he draws the top item card from the item deck and places it in his hand. If a hunter is in a small city, he does not draw an item card.</p>

<p>Then, an event card is drawn. When a player draws an event card, he must read it as some event cards must be played immediately. Event cards are drawn differently during day and night, as follows:</p>

<p><b>Day:</b> During day, hunters take a card from the top of the event deck. If the top card of the event deck has a hunter icon, the hunter draws the card by placing it in his hand. If the top card of the event deck has a Dracula icon, the card is placed facedown in the discard pile.</p>

<p><b>Night:</b> During night, hunters take a card from the bottom of the event deck. If the event card on the bottom of the deck has a hunter icon, the hunter draws the card by placing it in his hand. If the event card on the bottom of the deck has a Dracula icon, Dracula draws the card by placing it in his hand.</p>

<h3>3. Trade Action</h3>

<p>When a hunter performs a trade action, he chooses another hunter in the same city as him. The hunters can show each other their item cards and ticket tokens and give any of those cards and tokens to each other. This exchange is private.</p>

<h3>4. Special Action</h3>

<p>When a hunter performs a special action, he resolves either an effect from an event card in his hand or an ability from his character sheet that specifies that it can be used as an action.</p>

<h3>5. Reserve A Ticket Action</h3>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game16.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>To move by railway, hunters need to reserve tickets. When a hunter performs a reserve a ticket action, he gains a ticket token by taking it from the token pool. Then, he looks at it and places it in his play area. Each hunter can have two ticket tokens.</p>

<h3>6. Rest Action</h3>

<p>When a hunter performs a rest action, he recovers one damage.</p>

<h3>7. Search Action</h3>

<p>Dracula has the ability to hide encounter cards at locations he has visited. Hunters can use the search action to reveal these cards. This is explained in more detail later.</p>

<br>
<h2>Dracula Phase</h2>

<p>After each hunter has finished performing a night action, the Dracula phase begins. During the Dracula phase, Dracula leaves misery in his wake as he recruits supporters, creates vampires, and warps the forces of nature. During each Dracula phase, Dracula moves and then places an encounter card at his new location.</p>

<h3>Moving</h3>

<p>Dracula can move by road and by sea, but he cannot move by railway. Instead of moving his figure on the board like hunters, Dracula tracks his movement by placing location cards facedown on the trail. Dracula's location deck has one location card for each location on the board.</p>

<p>To move, Dracula slides all cards already on the trail one space to the right (see "Dracula Movement Example" on page 9). Then, he secretly chooses one card from the location deck and places the chosen card facedown on the first space of the trail. The location on the card he chooses must be adjacent to his current location. Dracula can use the reference map to help him determine his movement possibilities.</p>

<p>Sea location cards have a different card back from city location cards, which makes it dangerous for Dracula to move by sea because his location card will alert the hunters that he has done so. Additionally, each time Dracula moves from a port to a sea zone, he suffers two damage. Each time Dracula moves from a sea zone to another sea zone, he suffers one damage.</p>

<p>If Dracula moves to a city that a hunter occupies, Dracula is revealed.</p>

<br>

<blockquote class="white">

<h3>What Is The Trail</h3>

<p>The trail has six spaces and represents the locations where Dracula is and has been. Dracula uses the trail to covertly track his movement and to place encounter cards, which allow him to create vampires and hinder the hunters' attempts to find him.</p>

<p>The first space on the trail corresponds to Dracula's current location and is also where Dracula places location cards and encounter cards during the Dracula phase. Unless Dracula is revealed, his figure is placed in the circle above the first space of the trail.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game18.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Each space of the trail can contain one of Dracula's hideouts. A hideout comprises all cards and tokens on one of the trail's spaces. This is typically a location card with an encounter card.</p>

<p>During each Dracula phase, before Dracula chooses a location card, all hideouts on the trail slide to create space for Dracula's chosen card. Each hideout slides one space following the direction of the arrows.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Placing An Encounter Card</h4>

<p>After Dracula moves, he chooses an encounter card from his hand and places it facedown on top of the location card on the first space of the trail. If Dracula placed a sea location on the trail this turn, or if he is currently revealed, he cannot place an encounter card.</p>

<p>Encounter cards allow Dracula to impede the hunters in various ways by laying traps and creating vampires. If Dracula ever has fewer than five encounter cards in his hand, he draws encounter cards until he has five cards.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game19.jpg"><br>

<br>

<blockquote class="white">

<h3>Dracula Movement Example</h3>

<p>Dracula started the game in Nantes, moved to Clermont- Ferrand during the second day, and is now in Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Since the Nantes and Clermont-Ferrand cards are already on the trail, Dracula's movement options are limited to Toulouse, Santander, and the North Atlantic.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game21.jpg"><br><br>

<p>He slides all of the hideouts on the trail one space.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game22.jpg"><br><br>

<p>He cannot move to Paris or Sargossa as they are not adjacent, having only railways and no roads connecting them to Bordeaux. He chooses to move to Santander, removing that card from the location deck.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game20.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Then, he places Santander in the first space of the trail.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game23.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Finally, he chooses an encounter card from his hand and places it on top of Santander.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/fury-of-dracula/game24.jpg"><br><br>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p><b>Dracula wins the game</b> by advancing the influence track to space "13". He can advance the influence track in several ways, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maturing a vampire encounter card advances the track by a number of spaces specified on that card.</li>
<li>Resolving the "Fangs" combat card against a mesmerized hunter advances the track by one.</li>
<li>Defeating a hunter advances the track by two, plus one for each despair token on the board.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>hunters win the game</b> if Dracula has 15 damage tokens on his character sheet, thereby defeating him.</p>
