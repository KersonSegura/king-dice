<h2>Setup</h2>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/setup.jpg"><br><br>

<p>The game plays clockwise. Each player rolls the 6 black dice. Whoever has the most <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg"> results goes first. In case of tie, players roll dice until one player has the greatest number of <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg">.</p>

<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>You are a gigantic Monster willing to do anything to become King of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Your rampage brings you glory in the form of Victory Points (<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg">).</p>

<p>To win, be the first Monster to gain 20 Victory Points. Or, get your claws out and eliminate your enemies. The last one standing claims victory!</p>

<h2>Turn Overview</h2>

<ol>
<li>Roll Dice</li>
<li>Resolve Dice</li>
<li>Enter Tokyo</li>
<li>Buy Power cards</li>
<li>End of turn</li>

</ol>

<br>
<h2>I. Roll Dice</h2>

<p>On your turn, you can roll the dice up to three times. You can stop rolling any time.</p>

<p>On the first Roll, roll the 6 black dice (and 1 or 2 green dice if you have a Power card that lets you roll them). For your second Roll, if you like some of your results, you can set them aside and only roll the ones you don't like again. For your third Roll, if you change your mind, you can roll any dice you set aside again, along with any you still don't like.</p>

<p>After you finish your three Rolls (or you decide to stop), continue to the Resolve Dice step.</p>

<br>
<h2>II. Resolve Dice</h2>

<p>You can resolve your dice in any order, but you must resolve all of them.</p>

<p>Symbols rolled at the end of your last die Roll represent the actions of your turn:</p>

<h3>Victory Points <img src="https://ultraboardgames.com/king-of-tokyo/gfx/vp.jpg"></h3>

<p>If you roll three-of-a-kind of <img src="https://ultraboardgames.com/king-of-tokyo/gfx/1.jpg">, <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/2.jpg">, or <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/3.jpg"> gain as many <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg"> as the number.</p>

<p>Each additional die rolled with the same face gains you 1 additional <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg">.</p>

<h3>Energy <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/energy.jpg"></h3>

<p>Gain 1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/e.jpg"> from the pool for each <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/s.jpg"> rolled.</p>

<p>Place them in your reserve in front of yourself. Keep Energy cubes until you spend them.</p>

<h3>Smash <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/smash.jpg"></h3>

<p>Monsters that are not in the same place as you lose 1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> for each <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg"> rolled.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If you are in Tokyo (Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay) and you roll <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg">, all Monsters outside of Tokyo lose <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">.</p></li>

<li><p>If you are outside of Tokyo and you roll <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg">, all Monsters who are in Tokyo lose <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">. These Monsters can then decide to Yield and leave Tokyo or stay.</p>

<p>Monsters who Yield Tokyo still lose <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">.</p></li>

</ul><br>

<p>Each <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg"> results in losing one Life Point <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">. If a Monster loses his last Life Point then the <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/a.jpg"> appears and he is eliminated (his keep cards and Energy cubes are discarded). Since no Monster starts the game in Tokyo, the Monster who plays first does not cause Monsters to lose <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> with <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg">.</p>

<p>Note: <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> lost dealt from a Power card effect is different than <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg">. A Monster can only Yield Tokyo when losing <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> from <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg">.</p>

<h3>Heal <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/heal.jpg"></h3>

<p>If you are outside of Tokyo, you can gain 1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> for each <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/gl.jpg"> rolled.</p>

<p> If you are in Tokyo, the you roll <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/gl.jpg"> do not let you gain <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> (you can only gain <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> with Power cards).</p>

<p>Note: You can't gain <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> above 10 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">.</p>

<p>Example of a die roll:</p>

<br>
<h2>III. Enter Tokyo</h2>

<p>If no one is in Tokyo, you must enter and place your Monster in Tokyo City.</p>

<p>You can only Yield when you lose <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> from <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg"> rolled by a Monster.</p>

<p>Note: No Monster starts the game in Tokyo. The first player must enter Tokyo City during this step.</p>

<br>

<h3>Effects of tokyo</h3>

<p>Being in Tokyo (Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay) has some advantages and disadvantages:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg"> : You gain 1 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg"> when you enter Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>[+2 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg">] : You gain 2 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg"> if you start your turn in Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>Monsters in Tokyo cannot use <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/gl.jpg"> (but they can still use Power cards to gain <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Moreover, targets of your smash depend on where you are:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg"> of Monsters in Tokyo cause all Monsters outside of Tokyo to lose <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">.</p></li>

<li><p>The <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg"> of Monsters outside of Tokyo cause all Monsters in Tokyo to lose <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg">.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You can only leave Tokyo after losing <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/l.jpg"> from <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/h.jpg"> rolled by another Monster.</p>

<br>
<h2>IV. Buy power Cards</h2>

<p>You now may buy one or more of the three face-up cards. To buy a Power card, spend as many <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/e.jpg"> as the cost indicated at the top of the card. Replace bought cards immediately from the top of the deck. New cards are immediately available for purchase.</p>

<p>You can also spend 2 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/e.jpg"> to sweep all three face-up cards to the discard. Then reveal three new Power cards from the deck. They are immediately available for purchase.</p>

<p>As long as you have enough <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/e.jpg">, you can continue to buy or sweep cards.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/example5.jpg" class="border"><br>

<br>
<h2>V. End of Turn</h2>

<p>Certain Power card effects activate at the end of your turn.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/box.jpg" class="floatr">

<p>Once you're done, pass the dice to the player on your left.</p>

<br>
<h2>End of the game</h2>

<p>The game ends at the end of a round when a Monster reaches 20 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg"> or if only one Monster remains.</p>

<p>The Monster who reaches 20 <img src="scraped_rules/images/king-of-tokyo/v.jpg"> or is the last survivor is crowned King of Tokyo!</p>
