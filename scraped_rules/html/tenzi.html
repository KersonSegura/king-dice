<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>
<ul>
<li>

<p>Someone says "Go" and everyone rolls at the same time. Quickly look at your roll and decide which number you are going to go for.</p>

<p>For example, if you have more 3's than any other number, that's what you want to go for.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Put all your dice with that number aside, collect the remaining dice and quickly roll again.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>You do not have to wait for others to roll again. Everyone rolls together only on the first roll.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Keep rolling until all ten of your dice show the same number.</p>

</li>
</ul>
