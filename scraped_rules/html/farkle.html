<h2>Components</h2>
<ul>
<li>6 Dice</li>
<li>Shaker Cup</li>
<li>Score Pad</li>
<li>Rulebook</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Object of the Game</h2>

<p>Be the player with the highest score over 10,000.</p>

<br>
<h2>Farkle Facts</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Single 1s and 5s are worth points.</p></li>

<li><p>Other numbers count if you get three or more of the same number in a single roll.</p></li>

<li><p>Other combinations of numbers are worth points if you get them in a single roll. Note: Dice from multiple rolls cannot be added together.<br><br>For example, if you set aside one 5 (50 points) on your first roll and two 5s (100 points) on your second roll, you have 150 points. You cannot add them together to make three 5s (500 points).</p></li>

<li><p>Some scoring dice must be removed after every roll.</p></li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Pick one player to be the scorekeeper.</p></li>

<li><p>All players roll one Die. Whoever has the highest roll goes first, with play passing to the left.</p></li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>When it's your turn, place the six Dice in the Shaker Cup and roll 'em. Any Dice that roll off the playing area are rolled again.</p>

<p>After each roll, set aside Dice that are worth points and roll the rest of them. You must remove at least one Die after each roll and keep a running total of your points for that turn.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to set aside all six Dice, you can roll them all again to build your running total.</p>

<p>If you cannot set aside any Dice after a roll, that's a Farkle. You lose your running total of points for that turn and play passes to the left. A Farkle could happen on your first roll or when you roll the remaining Dice.</p>

<p>To get on the Score Pad for the first time, you must have a running total of 500 points before you stop rolling.</p>

<p>After your first score of 500 points or more is recorded, you may stop rolling at any time and have the scorekeeper add your running total for that turn to your accumulated score. Once your points are entered on the Score Pad, they are safe, and you cannot lose them.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<ul>
<li>Single 1 = 100</li>
<li>Single 5 = 50</li>
<li>Three 1s = 300</li>
<li>Three 2s = 200</li>
<li>Three 3s = 300</li>
<li>Three 4s = 400</li>
<li>Three 5s = 500</li>
<li>Three 6s = 600</li>
<li>Four of any number = 1,000</li>
<li>Five of any number = 2,000</li>
<li>Six of any number = 3,000</li>
<li>1-6 straight = 1,500</li>
<li>Three pairs = 1,500</li>
<li>Four of any number with a pair = 1,500</li>
<li>Two triplets = 2,500</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p>When a player's accumulated score is 10,000 or more, each of the other players has one last turn to beat that total.</p>

<p>The <b>player with the highest score wins</b>.</p>

<h3>Sample Roll</h3>
<ul>
<li>

<h5>First roll (six Dice): <img src="scraped_rules/images/farkle/game1.jpg"></h5>

<p>You set aside 5 (50 points).</p>
</li>
<li>

<h5>Second roll (five remaining Dice): <img src="scraped_rules/images/farkle/game2.jpg"></h5>

<p>You set aside 1 (100) and Triple 4s (400), bringing your running total to 550.</p>

<p>You can now stop rolling to avoid a Farkle and mark 550 on the Score Pad, or roll the single die if you're feeling lucky and think you'll get a 1 or 5.</p>

<h5>Third roll (one remaining Die): <img src="scraped_rules/images/farkle/game3.jpg"></h5>

<p>This 1 (100), brings your running total to 650. Now, you can roll all six Dice again. Your chances of getting a Farkle with six Dice are slim, but it could happen!</p>
</li>
<li>

<h5>Fourth roll (all six Dice): <img src="scraped_rules/images/farkle/game4.jpg"></h5>

<p>You set aside Triple 3s (300) and decide to stop so you don't risk your 950 points by getting a Farkle. Your running total of 950 is added to the Score Pad.</p>
