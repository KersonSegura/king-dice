<h2>Game Pla</h2>

<div class="box green_border">

<p>A turn consists of one pop and a move (if possible).</p>

</div>

<div class="infobox"><div class="info-icon info-icon2"><i></i></div><div class="infobox-body">

<p><b>Important:</b> If a number 6 is popped, the player gets an additional pop and move.</p>

</div></div>
<ol>
<li>

<p>On your first turn, you must pop a number 6 to move one of your pegs out of HOME and into START on the playing track. You pop only once.</p>

<div class="box yellow_bg">

<p>If you do not pop a 6 on your first turn you cannot move any of your pegs and must wait until your next turn to try again.</p>

<p>Once you pop a 6, move one of your pegs into START. Pop again (remember, you have a free turn for popping a 6) and move the peg in START on the playing track the number of spaces shown on the die.</p>
</div></li>
<li>

<p>Always move your pegs clockwise around the playing track. Count each space whether it is empty or full.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>Pop and move all of your pegs as above. When you pop a 6, you can either move a new peg out to START, or move a peg already in the playing track. Then pop again. If you pop any other number, move one of your pegs already in the playing track.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>If your peg lands on a space that already has an opponent's peg in it, the opponent's peg returns to its HOME and must start all over again.</p>

<img src="scraped_rules/images/trouble/game3.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Your peg now occupies that space.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>If another player's peg is in your START space when you roll a 6 and want to move a peg out of HOME, that player's peg is sent back to HOME and you move your peg into START If your own peg is in your START space when you pop a 6, you cannot bring a new peg out.</p>

<p>You must use the 6 to move a peg already in the playing track. You cannot land on your own pegs.</p>
</li>
<li>

<div class="box yellow2_bg">

<p><b>The Finish Line:</b> When a peg has moved once around the gameboard, it enters its matching color FINISH line. A peg can not go around the gameboard more than once.</p>

<p>A peg can only enter FINISH if the exact number required to get into one of the FINISH spaces is popped. Pegs in FINISH are safe from other players' pegs because no player can move into another player's FINISH line.</p>

<p>Pegs can move within a FINISH area only in the direction of the arrows and by exact count of the die.</p>

</div>

</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p>The first player to move all 4 pegs of his/her color once around the gameboard and into FINISH is the winner. The game continues to see who comes in second or third.</p>
